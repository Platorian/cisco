### Hello World

```c 
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

	printf("Hello World!\n")
	printf("This is my first program")
	return 0;
}
```

### Compile and Run C from the Terminal

Check if you have gcc installed
```sh
gcc -v
```

Compile 
```sh
gcc <path-to-program> -o <output-name>
```
- You can always cd into the directory to save you from having to enter the path to file
