```c
#include <stdin.h>

int main()
{
   // memory = an array of bytes within RAM (street)
   // memory block = a single unit (byte) within memory (house), used to hold some value (person)
   // memory address = the address of where a memory block is located (house address)

	char a = 'X';
	char b = 'Y';
	char c = 'Z';

	printf("%d bytes\n", sizeof(a));
	printf("%d bytes\n", sizeof(b));
	printf("%d bytes\n", sizeof(c));

	printf("%p\n", &a);    // Memeory addresses
	printf("%p\n", &b);
	printf("%p\n", &c);

	return 0;
}	
```
- Hex = 0-9 and A-F (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F)
- A short would use two bytes so the addresses would go down by two bytes each time
- Try changing the variables from char to short, int, and double and see how it changes
