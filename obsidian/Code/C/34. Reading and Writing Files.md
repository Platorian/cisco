### Writing Files

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

int main() {
   
   // WRITE/APPEND A FILE
   
   FILE *pF = fopen("C:\\Users\\Cakow\\Desktop\\test.txt", "w");

   fprintf(pF, "Spongebob Squarepants");

   fclose(pF);
 
	return 0;
}
```
- `w` - Write
- `a` - Append
- `r` - Read
### Reading Files

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

   FILE *pF = fopen("poem.txt", "r");
   char buffer[255]; // Holds one line of the file, one line at a time

   if(pF == NULL) // Check the file exists
   {
      printf("Unable to open file!\n");
   }
   else
   {   // If it does not return NULL it will keep printing what's in the buffer
      while(fgets(buffer, 255, pF) != NULL)
      {
         printf("%s", buffer);
      }
   }

   fclose(pF);

	return 0;
}
```
- Needs the full path-to-file
- if you're getting an error/segmentation fault when testing with a non existent file, move the fclose() inside the else. fclose can't close a file that is not open so it will segment fault
### Delete a File

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

   // DELETE A FILE
  
   if(remove("test.txt") == 0)
   {
      printf("That file was deleted successfully!");
   }
   else
   {
      printf("That file was NOT deleted!");
   }
   
	return 0;
}
```
