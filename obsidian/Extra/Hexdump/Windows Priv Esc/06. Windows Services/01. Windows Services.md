Windows Services are `special processes` that can be configured within windows.

Specifically, Windows Services can execute without user interaction and continue to execute even after the user has logged off. They usually run in the background when the machine is booted.

In Linux it is like a Deamon.

They are managed with the `Services Control Manager panel`.

There exists different "types" of services:
  - Local Services
  - Network Services
  - System Services
  - Third party application services

They offer a very interesting `attack surface area`, and therefore they should be studied very well.
