## History Logs

Any command we write using powershell could be saved in the history.

Get history in memory
```powershell
Get-History
```

Get file where the history is saved
```powershell
(Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath
```

Default locations:

```

- Linux
```sh
$HOME/.local/share/powershell/PSReadLine/ConsoleHost_history.txt
```

## Transcript

The `transcript` is used to keep track of execute commands. If not properly handled, it could could sensitive data and therefore represent a security risk.

Start transcript and save into a file
```powershell
Start-Transcript -Path "C:\Users\Quickemu\Desktop\Log.txt"
```

```powershell
Stop transcript
```
