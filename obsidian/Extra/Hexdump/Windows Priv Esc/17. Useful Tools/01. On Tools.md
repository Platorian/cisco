## Why do we use Tools?

`Tools` are an integral part of Computer Science, and therefore of Cybersecurity. We use tools to automate tasks that would otherwise take `time` and `effort`, which are scarce resources.

In my opinion, a tool is useful if and only if:
1. It precisely defines the context in which it works properly.
2. It is simple to use relative to the functions it offers.
3. It can be easily integrated into automation workflows.
4. It is clear and concise.
5. It is as minimal as possible.
6. It can be easily understood and modified.

Regardless of how many tools you use, always try to understand what is the action that the tool is doing, to see how you yourself would implement such action.

Tools are useful, but the best tool remains the mind.
