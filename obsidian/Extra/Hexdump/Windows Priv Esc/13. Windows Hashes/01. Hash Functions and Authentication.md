## Hash Functions: Theory and Applications

Hash functions are one-way functions that allow you to go from the original password `P` to the hashed value `H(P)`.

Example:
> P -> H(P)

For example, `sha256` is a commonly used hash function. In Linux systems, it is possible to access such function with the `sha256sum` utility:
```sh
echo -n "leonardo" | sha256sum
```

Output
```sh

```

## Hash Functions and Authentication

In the context of authentication, hash functions are used for protecting users credentials since:

- they are easy to compute
- they are hard to reverse

Web applications for example store the hash of the user password within a database. This allow the application to verify the authenticity of the client during login.

Hashes are also used in the Windows operating system for authentication purposes.

Authentication Procedure:

Example:
> 1. User gives Password P to process
> 2. Process computes hash H(P)
> 3. Process checks that the hash H(P) is present in a trusted data source
> 4. If it is, authentication succeeds
> 5. If it is not, authentication fails
