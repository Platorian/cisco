## Registry Hives

The Windows registry is a hierarchical database structured following a tree-like data structure into `registry hives`.

Each hive is made up of multiple keys and values, and these hives are stored as files on the system. These data sources are very useful for `threat intelligence`, as they can be used as `Indicator of Compromise` (IOC) for specific malware.

There are five hives, and these are:
- HKCR: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
- HKLM: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
- HKU: HKEY_USERS
- HKCU: HKEY_CURRENT_USER
- HKCC: HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG

For each hive, we have a respective file:
- HKCR: C:\Windows\System32\Config\Software
- HKLM: C:\Windows\System32\Config\SYSTEM
- HKU: C:\Windows\System32\Config\DEFAULT
- HKCU: C:\Users\<UserName>\NTUSER.DAT
- HKCC: C:\Windows\System32\Config\SystemProfile

## Critical Registry Paths

Certain registry paths could lead to security risk if miss-configured, as they can be abused to obtain privilege escalation.
