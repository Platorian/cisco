## Reverse Shell vs Bind Shell

When we obtain **code execution** on a vulnerable system, it is useful to spawn a **shell** that can be controlled through a remote connection.

To do this there are two main techniques:

  - **Bind Shell**

The attacker forces the vulnerable compromised server to open a port and to listen for incoming connections. The problem with this is that it's seen as a malicious activity.  

Example:
> Attacker Machine ---> Compromised System

The compromised system acts as a server, while the attacker machine acts a client.

- **Reverse Shell**

The attacker forces the vulnerable compromised system to initiate a connection to the attacker machine.

Example:
> Compromised System ---> Attacker Machine

The attacker machine now acts as the server, with a public IP on which it listens for incoming connections. The compromised system instead acts as a client.

The TCP/IP Protocol stack allows us to communicate over the internet.

## Why Reverse Shells are Better

Since using reverse shells the connection is outbound, network-wise it is more difficult to protect your system from reverse shell connections.

That is, it is typically OK to connect to the public internet, while it is more dangerous to open a port in your network infrastructure to listen for incoming connections.

In both cases however the idea is to obtain **remote control over a shell process**.  This can be really dangerous for the security of a system.
