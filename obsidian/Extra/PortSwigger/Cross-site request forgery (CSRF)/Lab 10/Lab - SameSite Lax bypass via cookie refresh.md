This lab's change email function is vulnerable to CSRF. To solve the lab, perform a CSRF attack that changes the victim's email address. You should use the provided exploit server to host your attack.

The lab supports OAuth-based login. You can log in via your social media account with the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

#### Note

>The default SameSite restrictions differ between browsers. As the victim uses Chrome, we recommend also using Chrome (or Burp's built-in Chromium browser) to test your exploit.
