This online shop has a live chat feature implemented using WebSockets.

Chat messages that you submit are viewed by a support agent in real time.

To solve the lab, use a WebSocket message to trigger an `alert()` popup in the support agent's browser.

**Goal:** To solve the lab, use a WebSocket message to trigger an `alert()` popup in the support agent's browser.

**Analysis:** The app has a message system that can be manipulated allowing me to use an XSS attack. 
1. Start burp and navigate to the lab web server
2. The vulnerability is found in the `live chat` tab
3. Sending a message opens the websockets and i send the request to repeater
4. in the repeater i can modify the message to test for XSS
