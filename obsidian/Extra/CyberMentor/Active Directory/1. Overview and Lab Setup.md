- Fill in the details
	- First Name: Frank
	- Last Name: Castle
	- User Logon Name: fcastle

- File and storage services (on the far left)
- Shares
- On the tasks drop down click new share
- SMB share - quick

This opens up ports 139 and 445 so that we have SMB enabled on the DC.

```cmd
setspn -a HYDRA-DC/SQLService.MARVEL.local:60111 MARVEL\SQLSevrvice

```

**Group policy management**
- Search and right click to open as admin
- Open Domains > MARVEL.local
- Right click and create a GPO in this domain
	- Call it: Disable Windows Defender

For this lab, we will disable WD as we work through the AD techniques and tools. Why are we not using AV evasion? AV evasion will be updated regularly, so what's in the course might not work at a later stage.     
- Right click on the new policy and select edit
- Computer config > policies > administrative templates > windows components > windows defender antivirus (close to the bottom of the list) 
- On the right you should see an option to turn off windows defender antivirus

Enable Frank Castle to be a local admin

- Select add to add a user as a local admin
	- Type fcastle and use check names to finish the name off

If you have another machine which would be Peter Parker's computer, you would now do the same steps, making Frank Castle a local admin on that machine as well as Peter Parker. 

Peter Parker's computer would be named SPIDERMAN. 

I don't have the CPUs to run everything so i'll have to use just the one machine: THEPUNISHER, for now.
