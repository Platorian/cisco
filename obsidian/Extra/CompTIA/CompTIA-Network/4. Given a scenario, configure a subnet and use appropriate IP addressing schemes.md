4 - Given a scenario, configure a subnet and use appropriate IP addressing schemes.
=====================================================================================

Public vs. private
==================

Private IP addresses are used within a private network and are not routable on the Internet, while public IP addresses are used to connect to the Internet and are globally unique.

RFC1918
-------

RFC1918 is a standard that defines three private IP address ranges: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. These IP addresses are reserved for use within a private network and cannot be used on the Internet.

Network address translation (NAT)
---------------------------------

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technique used to allow devices with private IP addresses to connect to the Internet by mapping their private IP addresses to a public IP address. This allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address, which can help conserve public IP addresses. NAT can be implemented using a router or firewall device.

Port address translation (PAT)
------------------------------

Port Address Translation (PAT) is a variation of NAT that allows multiple devices with private IP addresses to share a single public IP address and port number combination. PAT uses unique port numbers to map private IP addresses to a single public IP address, allowing multiple devices to communicate over the Internet simultaneously.

IPv4 vs. IPv6
=============

IPv4 is a 32-bit address that allows for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. IPv6 is a 128-bit address that allows for approximately 340 undecillion unique addresses. IPv6 was developed to address the shortage of IPv4 addresses and to improve the efficiency and security of IP addressing.

Automatic Private IP
--------------------

Addressing (APIPA)

Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is a feature in Windows that automatically assigns a private IP address to a device when it cannot obtain an IP address from a DHCP server. This allows the device to communicate within the local network, but not outside of it.

Extended unique identifier (EUI-64)
-----------------------------------

Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-64) is a method used in IPv6 to generate unique interface identifiers. The interface identifier is used to identify a network interface card and is part of an IPv6 address.

Multicast
---------

Multicast is a method of sending a single packet to multiple recipients. The packet is sent to a single multicast address, and all devices subscribed to that address receive the packet.

Unicast
-------

Unicast is a method of sending a packet to a single recipient. The packet is sent to a single IP address.

Anycast
-------

Anycast is a method of sending a packet to the nearest device among a group of devices that share the same IP address. Anycast is often used for load balancing and redundancy.

Broadcast
---------

Broadcast is a method of sending a packet to all devices on a network. The packet is sent to the broadcast address, which is a special address that represents all devices on the network.

Link local
----------

Link-local addressing is a method of assigning an IP address to a device that is only valid within a local network segment. Link-local addresses are used for communication between devices on the same network segment.

Loopback
--------

Loopback is a special IP address that represents the device itself. Packets sent to the loopback address are routed back to the device, allowing for testing and troubleshooting of network services on the device.

Default gateway
---------------

Default gateway is the IP address of the device that allows a device to communicate with devices on other networks. All traffic destined for other networks is sent to the default gateway, which then routes the traffic to the appropriate network.

IPv4 subnetting
===============

Classless (variable-length
--------------------------

subnet mask)

Classless addressing, also known as variable-length subnet masking (VLSM), allows for more flexibility in subnetting by using a subnet mask that is not based on the class of the IP address. This allows for more efficient use of IP addresses and more flexible network design.

Classful
--------

Classful addressing is an IPv4 addressing scheme that divides IP addresses into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E. Each class has a predefined subnet mask and network size, with the first octet of the IP address used to identify the class. Class A addresses are used for large networks, Class B addresses are used for medium-sized networks, and Class C addresses are used for small networks. Class D addresses are used for multicast addressing, and Class E addresses are reserved for future use.

Classless Inter-Domain
----------------------

Routing (CIDR) notation

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation is a method of representing a subnet mask using a slash (/) followed by the number of bits in the subnet mask. For example, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 can be represented in CIDR notation as /24, indicating that the first 24 bits of the IP address are used for the network portion and the remaining 8 bits are used for the host portion.

IPv6 concepts
=============

Tunnelling
----------

Tunneling is a method of encapsulating IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets so that they can be routed over an IPv4 network. This is necessary because IPv4 and IPv6 are not compatible with each other.

Dual stack
----------

Dual stack is a method of running both IPv4 and IPv6 on the same device. This allows devices to communicate with both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts.

Shorthand notation
------------------

Shorthand notation is a way of writing IPv6 addresses in a more concise form. The most common shorthand notation is to use hexadecimal instead of decimal numbers. For example, the IPv6 address 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:7a6e:0680:9668 can be written as 2001:db8::7a6e:680:9668.

Router advertisement
--------------------

A router advertisement is a message sent by a router to inform hosts on its network about the router's IPv6 address, subnet mask, and other routing information.

Stateless address
-----------------

autoconfiguration (SLAAC)

Stateless address autoconfiguration is a method of automatically assigning IPv6 addresses to hosts. SLAAC uses the router advertisement message to obtain the necessary information to configure the host's IPv6 address.

Virtual IP (VIP)
================

A virtual IP (VIP) is an IP address that is not assigned to a specific physical network interface. Instead, it is assigned to a group of hosts or servers. When a client sends a packet to the VIP, the packet is routed to one of the hosts in the group. This allows multiple hosts to share the same IP address and provide fault tolerance and scalability.

VIPs are often used in load balancing configurations. In a load balancing configuration, multiple servers are configured to handle requests for a particular service. The VIP is used to distribute requests across the servers. This ensures that no single server is overloaded and that requests are handled quickly and efficiently.

Sub interfaces
==============

A subinterface is a virtual interface created by dividing one physical interface into multiple logical interfaces. Subinterfaces use the parent physical interface for sending and receiving data.

Subinterfaces are used for a variety of purposes. For example, subinterfaces can be used to:

-   Connect multiple VLANs to a single router
-   Route traffic between multiple VLANs
-   Create multiple logical interfaces on a single physical interface
-   Provide redundancy for a physical interface
