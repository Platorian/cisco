2 - Explain the characteristics of network topologies and network types.
==========================================================================

Network Topologies
==================

Mesh Topology
-------------

In a mesh topology, each device is connected to every other device in the network. This creates a high degree of redundancy and fault tolerance, as multiple paths can be used to transmit data between devices. However, mesh topologies can be expensive to implement and can require a lot of cabling and configuration.

Mesh topologies are commonly used in mission-critical networks where high availability and fault tolerance are required. Examples of use cases include military communications, emergency response networks, and financial trading networks.

Star/Hub-and-Spoke Topology:
----------------------------

In a star/hub-and-spoke topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. This creates a centralized point of control and can simplify network management, as devices can be easily added or removed from the network. However, if the hub or switch fails, the entire network can go down, and the network can be less fault-tolerant than other topologies.

Star/hub-and-spoke topologies are commonly used in LANs (Local Area Networks) and small business networks. They can be cost-effective and easy to manage, and can support a variety of network services such as internet access, email, file sharing, and printing.

Bus Topology:
-------------

In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single cable, which acts as a backbone for the network. Data is transmitted along the cable, and devices receive only the data that is intended for them. Bus topologies can be relatively simple to implement and can be cost-effective for smaller networks. However, they can be less fault-tolerant than other topologies, as a failure in the cable or a single device can bring down the entire network.

Bus topologies are less commonly used in modern networks, but can still be found in legacy systems or small networks. Examples of use cases include industrial control systems, building automation systems, and some older Ethernet networks.

Ring Topology:
--------------

In a ring topology, devices are connected in a closed loop, with each device connected to its neighbours on either side. Data is transmitted around the ring in a single direction, and devices receive only the data that is intended for them. Ring topologies can be efficient and can provide fault tolerance, as data can be rerouted around a failed device. However, they can be more complex to implement than other topologies, and adding or removing devices can be more difficult.

Ring topologies are commonly used in LANs and metropolitan area networks (MANs). They can provide high reliability and fault tolerance, and are well-suited for networks that require high-speed data transmission and low latency, such as video surveillance networks, industrial control systems, and high-speed trading networks.

Hybrid Topology:
----------------

A hybrid topology combines two or more topologies to create a network that meets specific requirements. For example, a hybrid network might combine a star topology with a mesh topology to create a network that is both easy to manage and highly redundant. Hybrid topologies can be complex to implement, but they can provide the best of both worlds in terms of performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.

Hybrid topologies can be used in a wide range of network environments, depending on the specific requirements of the network. For example, a hybrid network might combine a star topology with a mesh topology to create a network that is both easy to manage and highly redundant. Examples of use cases include enterprise networks, data centre networks, and cloud computing networks.

Network types and characteristics
=================================

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network:
---------------------------

-   **Protocol Independence**: mGRE is protocol-independent, meaning that it can be used with a variety of network protocols such as IP or IPv6.

Service-related entry point
===========================

Demarcation point
-----------------

A Demarcation point (often abbreviated as demarc) is the physical point at which a telecommunications service provider's network ends and a customer's network begins. The demarcation point marks the boundary between the two networks and is typically located at the point of entry to a building or property.

At the demarcation point, the service provider is responsible for maintaining and repairing their network up to the point of the demarcation, while the customer is responsible for maintaining and repairing their network beyond the demarcation point. This helps to ensure that both parties have clear responsibilities and boundaries for network maintenance and troubleshooting.

The demarcation point typically includes equipment such as a network interface device (NID), which serves as a physical interface between the service provider's network and the customer's network. The NID may also include diagnostic and testing tools to help troubleshoot network issues.

Smartjack
---------

a Smartjack is a type of network interface device (NID) that is commonly used in telecommunications networks to provide a physical interface between a service provider's network and a customer's network. A Smartjack is a type of NID that includes additional features and functionality beyond a standard NID.

Some of the key features of a Smartjack include:

-   **Loopback Testing**: Smartjacks include loopback testing capabilities, which allow network administrators to test the integrity and functionality of the service provider's network without disrupting network traffic.
-   **Remote Management**: Smartjacks can be remotely managed, allowing network administrators to monitor network performance and troubleshoot issues from a central location.

-   **Carrier-Class Reliability**: Smartjacks are designed to provide carrier-class reliability, with redundant power supplies, cooling systems, and other features to ensure high availability and uptime.

Smartjacks are commonly used in telecommunications networks, particularly in T1 and T3 circuits, to provide reliable and high-performance network connectivity.

Virtual network concepts
========================

vSwitch
-------

A vSwitch, also known as a virtual switch, is a software-based switch used in virtualized environments to interconnect virtual machines (VMs) and link them to the physical network.

A vSwitch operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, just like a physical switch. It provides features such as VLAN tagging, link aggregation, and Quality of Service (QoS) settings. These features help manage the flow of network traffic between virtual machines and the physical network.

One of the significant benefits of a vSwitch is that it eliminates the need for dedicated physical switches for each virtual machine. Instead, multiple virtual machines can share a single vSwitch, making it a more cost-effective solution. Additionally, it enables administrators to create and manage virtual networks and segregate traffic more efficiently.

The vSwitch is typically managed through a hypervisor, such as VMware vSphere or Microsoft Hyper-V, and can be configured to meet specific network requirements

Virtual network interface card (vNIC)
-------------------------------------

A Virtual Network Interface Card (vNIC) is a software-based network interface that emulates a physical network interface card (NIC) in a virtualized environment. Like a physical NIC, a vNIC provides a unique identifier, or MAC address, to the virtual machine it is assigned to.

A vNIC operates at the Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and communicates with the virtual switch (vSwitch) to send and receive data. When a virtual machine communicates with the physical network, the vNIC encapsulates the data with a Layer 2 header and sends it to the vSwitch. The vSwitch then forwards the data to the physical network, where it is decapsulated, and the destination device receives it.

Virtualization platforms such as VMware vSphere or Microsoft Hyper-V allow administrators to create and manage vNICs, and assign them to virtual machines as needed. This provides flexibility and scalability in virtualized environments, allowing administrators to easily add or remove vNICs to virtual machines as necessary.

Network function virtualization (NFV)
-------------------------------------

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an architectural approach that aims to virtualize network services that were traditionally performed by physical network appliances. These services include functions such as firewalls, load balancers, routers, and switches.

With NFV, these network functions are replaced with virtualized instances of software that run on commodity servers, using standard hypervisors. This virtualization of network functions enables the deployment of new services faster, more cost-effectively, and with greater flexibility.

In an NFV architecture, network functions are separated from proprietary hardware devices and implemented as software-based virtual machines. These virtualized network functions (VNFs) can be rapidly deployed, scaled up or down as needed, and relocated across different data centers or cloud environments. Additionally, since these VNFs are running on commodity servers, it allows for better utilization of server resources and cost savings.

NFV can be used in a wide range of network environments, from enterprise data centers to service provider networks. It offers many benefits, including improved agility, reduced cost, and simplified management of network services. However, implementing an NFV architecture requires careful planning and consideration of factors such as performance, security, and compatibility with existing infrastructure.

Hypervisor
----------

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software layer that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) on a physical server. It allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical server by partitioning the server's resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, and allocating them to each virtual machine.

There are two types of hypervisors: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 hypervisors, also known as bare-metal hypervisors, run directly on the server's hardware, and provide direct access to the physical resources. They are generally more efficient than Type 2 hypervisors since they do not require a host operating system. Examples of Type 1 hypervisors include VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V.

Type 2 hypervisors, also known as hosted hypervisors, run on top of a host operating system, which in turn runs on the server's hardware. They are generally less efficient than Type 1 hypervisors since they must go through the host operating system to access the physical resources. Examples of Type 2 hypervisors include Oracle VirtualBox and VMware Workstation.

Provider links
==============

Satellite
---------

A satellite provider link is a type of network connection that uses a satellite as the medium for transmitting data between two or more locations. This type of link is commonly used in areas where traditional wired or wireless connections are not feasible, such as remote or rural locations.

In terms of network topology, a satellite provider link typically uses a point-to-point topology, where data is transmitted directly between the satellite and the ground station. This topology allows for a dedicated and secure connection between the two locations, and can be used for both voice and data transmissions.

From a network type perspective, a satellite provider link can be classified as a wide area network (WAN). This is because it typically connects geographically dispersed locations over a large distance. A satellite provider link can also be considered a wireless network since the connection is established using radio waves transmitted through the air.

However, it's worth noting that satellite provider links can have some limitations, including latency and bandwidth constraints. The distance that the signal must travel between the satellite and the ground station can introduce delays, which can impact real-time applications such as voice and video. Additionally, satellite links often have lower bandwidth capacity than traditional wired or wireless connections, which can limit the amount of data that can be transmitted at any given time.

Digital subscriber line (DSL)
-----------------------------

Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is a type of broadband connection that uses existing copper telephone lines to transmit data. DSL operates on the physical layer of the OSI model, using high-frequency bands to transmit data over the phone line while allowing voice communication to operate simultaneously.

In terms of network topology, DSL typically uses a point-to-point topology, where data is transmitted directly between the customer premises equipment (CPE) and the Internet Service Provider's (ISP) equipment at the central office or remote terminal. This topology allows for a dedicated and secure connection between the customer and the ISP, and can be used for both voice and data transmissions.

From a network type perspective, DSL can be classified as a local area network (LAN) or a metropolitan area network (MAN) depending on the distance between the customer's location and the ISP's equipment. DSL can also be considered a wired network since the connection is established using copper telephone lines.

DSL has several advantages over other types of broadband connections. For example, it provides a dedicated connection to the Internet, allowing for faster download and upload speeds compared to shared connections. Additionally, it is widely available, as it uses existing telephone infrastructure, which means that it is accessible to customers in both urban and rural areas.

However, DSL does have some limitations. Its performance can be impacted by the distance between the customer premises equipment and the ISP's equipment, with performance degrading over longer distances. Additionally, the quality of the connection can be impacted by line noise, interference from other devices on the telephone line, or the condition of the copper wiring.

Cable
-----

Cable Internet is a type of broadband connection that uses the same coaxial cables that are used to transmit cable television signals to transmit data. Cable Internet operates on the physical layer of the OSI model, using high-frequency bands to transmit data over the cable while allowing television signals to operate simultaneously.

In terms of network topology, Cable Internet typically uses a hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) topology, where fibre optic cables are used to transmit data between the Internet Service Provider's (ISP) central office and neighbourhood nodes, while coaxial cables are used to transmit data between the nodes and customer premises equipment (CPE). This topology allows for a shared connection between multiple customers in a neighbourhood, which can reduce costs and improve efficiency.

From a network type perspective, Cable Internet can be classified as a hybrid network, as it combines elements of both wired and wireless networks. While the connection is established using wired coaxial cables, the shared nature of the connection means that the speed and performance of the connection can be impacted by the number of users on the network.

Cable Internet has several advantages over other types of broadband connections. For example, it provides a high-speed connection to the Internet that is widely available in urban and suburban areas. Additionally, the shared nature of the connection can result in lower costs for customers, as the cost of the shared infrastructure is spread out among multiple users.

However, Cable Internet also has some limitations. Its performance can be impacted by the number of users on the network, with speeds slowing down during peak usage times. Additionally, the shared nature of the connection can result in a lack of privacy and security, as other users on the network can potentially access a customer's data.

Leased line
-----------

a leased line is a dedicated point-to-point circuit that provides a high-speed, secure, and reliable connection between two locations. A leased line operates on the physical layer of the OSI model and typically uses fibre-optic or copper cabling to transmit data.

In terms of network topology, a leased line typically uses a point-to-point topology, where data is transmitted directly between the two locations that are connected by the leased line. This topology allows for a dedicated and secure connection between the two locations, and can be used for both voice and data transmissions.

From a network type perspective, a leased line can be classified as a wide area network (WAN) since it typically connects geographically dispersed locations over a large distance. It can also be considered a dedicated network, as the connection is exclusive to the two locations that are connected by the leased line.

Leased lines have several advantages over other types of network connections. For example, they provide a dedicated and secure connection that is not shared with other users, ensuring consistent performance and reliable data transmission. Additionally, leased lines typically offer high-speed connectivity, with speeds ranging from 64 kilobits per second (Kbps) up to several gigabits per second (Gbps), depending on the capacity of the leased line.

However, leased lines also have some limitations. They can be expensive to install and maintain, and require a long-term commitment from the customer. Additionally, the distance between the two locations that are connected by the leased line can impact the cost of the connection, with longer distances resulting in higher costs.

Metro-optical
-------------

Metro-optical, also known as metro Ethernet, is a type of network connection that uses optical fibre to connect geographically dispersed locations within a metropolitan area. Metro-optical operates on the physical layer of the OSI model, using light signals to transmit data over the optical fibre.

In terms of network topology, Metro-optical typically uses a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint topology, where data is transmitted directly between the two locations that are connected by the optical fibre or between multiple locations that are connected to the same optical fibre. This topology allows for a dedicated and secure connection between the locations, and can be used for both voice and data transmissions.

From a network type perspective, Metro-optical can be classified as a metropolitan area network (MAN), as it typically connects geographically dispersed locations within a metropolitan area. It can also be considered a wired network, since the connection is established using optical fibre.

Metro-optical has several advantages over other types of network connections. For example, it provides a high-speed, reliable, and secure connection between multiple locations within a metropolitan area. Additionally, it is flexible and scalable, allowing businesses and organizations to add or remove locations from the network as needed.

However, Metro-optical also has some limitations. It can be expensive to install and maintain, and requires a long-term commitment from the customer. Additionally, the performance of the connection can be impacted by the quality of the optical fibre or the distance between the locations that are connected.
