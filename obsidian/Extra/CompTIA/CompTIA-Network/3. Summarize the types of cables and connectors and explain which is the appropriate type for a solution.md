============================================================================================================

Copper
======

Copper cables, including twisted pair, coaxial, and twinaxial, are commonly used in networking. Different categories of twisted pair cable, including Cat 5, Cat 5e, Cat 6, Cat 6a, Cat 7, and Cat 8, are capable of supporting different bandwidths and data transmission speeds over varying distances. There are two termination standards, TIA/EIA-568A and TIA/EIA-568B, for terminating twisted pair cables with different color-coding schemes. Choosing the appropriate type of copper cable and termination standard is essential to ensure proper communication.

Twisted pair
------------

This is a type of cable commonly used in Ethernet networks that consists of pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together. The twisting of the wires helps to reduce interference from external sources. Twisted pair cables are available in different categories, including:

### Cat 5

This is an older category of twisted pair cable that is capable of supporting up to 100 Mbps data transmission over a maximum distance of 100 meters.

### Cat 5e

This is an enhanced version of Cat 5 cable that is capable of supporting up to 1 Gbps data transmission over a maximum distance of 100 meters.

### Cat 6

This is a newer category of twisted pair cable that is capable of supporting up to 10 Gbps data transmission over a maximum distance of 55 meters.

### Cat 6a

This is an augmented version of Cat 6 cable that is capable of supporting up to 10 Gbps data transmission over a maximum distance of 100 meters.

### Cat 7

This is a newer category of twisted pair cable that is capable of supporting up to 10 Gbps data transmission over a maximum distance of 100 meters.

### Cat 8

This is the latest category of twisted pair cable that is capable of supporting up to 40 Gbps data transmission over a maximum distance of 30 meters.

Coaxial/RG-6
------------

This is a type of cable commonly used for cable television and satellite communication that consists of a central conductor surrounded by an insulating layer, a braided shield, and an outer jacket. RG-6 is a type of coaxial cable that is capable of supporting higher bandwidths and longer distances than RG-59, another type of coaxial cable.

Twinaxial
---------

This is a type of cable that consists of two coaxial cables twisted together. It is commonly used in high-speed networking applications, such as InfiniBand and Fibre Channel.

Termination standards
---------------------

There are two commonly used termination standards for twisted pair cables, TIA/EIA-568A and TIA/EIA-568B. These standards define the color-coding scheme for the wires in the cable and the order in which they are terminated at the connector. Both standards are equally valid, but it is important to use the same standard on both ends of the cable to ensure proper communication.

In summary, copper cables are a common type of cable used in networking and are available in several categories, including twisted pair, coaxial, and twinaxial. Choosing the appropriate type of copper cable will depend on factors such as required bandwidth, distance, and data transmission speed. It is also important to use the appropriate termination standard to ensure proper communication.

Fiber (Fibre)
=============

Single-mode fiber is a type of optical fiber that is designed for high-speed, long-distance data transmission. Unlike multi-mode fiber, which uses a larger core and allows multiple paths for light to travel, single-mode fiber uses a much smaller core, typically around 9 microns in diameter, which allows light to travel along a single path, or mode, through the fiber.

The small core size of single-mode fiber means that it is capable of transmitting data over much longer distances than multi-mode fiber, with lower signal attenuation and less distortion. Single-mode fiber is also capable of higher bandwidth and data rates, making it ideal for high-speed data transmission over long distances.

Single-mode fiber is commonly used in telecommunications networks, long-haul data transmission, and high-speed internet connections. It is also used in fiber-optic sensors and measurement systems.

The main advantage of single-mode fiber over multi-mode fiber is its ability to transmit data over longer distances with higher bandwidth and less signal attenuation. However, single-mode fiber is more expensive than multi-mode fiber and requires more precise alignment of the optical components used to transmit and receive data.

### Single-mode fiber

-   Has a small core size, typically around 9 microns in diameter, which allows light to travel along a single path.
-   Provides higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances than multi-mode fiber.
-   Is more expensive than multi-mode fiber.
-   Requires more precise alignment of the optical components used to transmit and receive data.

### Multi-mode fiber:

-   Has a larger core size, typically 50 or 62.5 microns in diameter, which allows multiple paths for light to travel.
-   Provides lower bandwidth and shorter transmission distances than single-mode fiber.
-   Is less expensive than single-mode fiber.
-   Requires less precise alignment of the optical components used to transmit and receive data.

Connector Types
===============

Different types of connectors are used in network installations, including LC, ST, SC, MT, RJ11, RJ45, and F-type connectors, which are used in fiber optic, copper-based, or coaxial cable networks. APC and UPC are types of fiber optic connector endfaces that have been polished to different angles to improve signal quality. Transceivers and media converters are used to convert network signals from one media type to another, while SFP, SFP+, QSFP, and QSFP+ are different types of transceiver modules used in fiber optic networks, each designed for specific applications based on speed and form factor.

Local connector (LC), straight tip (ST), subscriber connector (SC), mechanical transfer (MT), and registered jack (RJ)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LC, ST, and SC connectors are used in fiber optic networks to terminate and connect fiber optic cables to networking devices, such as switches and routers. LC connectors are small form-factor connectors commonly used in high-density installations, while SC connectors are larger but more commonly used in most installations. ST connectors have a bayonet-style locking mechanism and are commonly used in older installations.

MT connectors are used in multi-fiber applications and have a mechanical transfer mechanism to align and connect multiple fibers simultaneously.

RJ connectors are used in copper-based networks and are typically used for connecting networking devices to copper Ethernet cables. RJ stands for registered jack and refers to the standard used for the connector.

Angled physical contact (APC) and ultra-physical contact (UPC)
--------------------------------------------------------------

APC and UPC are types of fiber optic connector endfaces that have been polished to different angles to reduce back-reflections and improve signal quality.

APC connectors have a 8-degree angle endface.

UPC connectors have a 0-degree angle endface.

APC connectors are commonly used in applications where high signal quality is required, such as digital video broadcasting, while UPC connectors are more commonly used in data networking applications.

RJ11 and RJ45
-------------

RJ11 and RJ45 are two types of connectors commonly used in copper-based networks.

-   RJ11 connectors are typically used for telephone connections and have four wires, while RJ45 connectors are typically used for Ethernet connections and have eight wires.
-   The two connectors are physically similar, but not interchangeable due to differences in the number of wires and the pin-out of the connectors.

F-type connector
----------------

-   F-type connectors are used in coaxial cable networks and are typically used for connecting cable modems, televisions, and other devices to the cable network.
-   The connectors are threaded, which helps to provide a secure and stable connection.

Transceivers/media converters
-----------------------------

-   Transceivers and media converters are used to convert network signals from one media type to another, such as from fiber optic to copper or vice versa.

-   QSFP (quad small form-factor pluggable) and QSFP+ (enhanced quad small form-factor pluggable) are used for higher-speed applications, such as 40 Gigabit Ethernet and 100 Gigabit Ethernet, respectively.

Cable management
================

Patch panels and patch bays are used to manage and organize network connections, typically mounted on a wall or rack with multiple ports for connecting incoming network cables. Fiber distribution panels are used in fiber optic networks to distribute incoming fiber optic cables to multiple locations. Punchdown blocks are used to terminate and manage network cabling, with different types including 66, 110, Krone, and Bix blocks. Each block has a different number of rows and connectors, with the wires secured in the connector by punching them down with a tool.
