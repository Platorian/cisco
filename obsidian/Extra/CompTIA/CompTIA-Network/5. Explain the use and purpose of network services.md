5 - Explain the use and purpose of network services.
======================================================

DHCP
====

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol that allows devices to automatically obtain IP addresses and other network configuration information. DHCP is used on most networks today, as it is much more efficient than manually configuring each device.

DHCP works by using a four-step process:

1.  **Discover:**Â When a device boots up, it sends a DHCPDISCOVER message to the network. This message is a broadcast message, which means that it is sent to all devices on the network.
2.  **Offer:**Â The DHCP server receives the DHCPDISCOVER message and sends a DHCPOFFER message to the device. The DHCPOFFER message offers the device an IP address and other configuration information.
3.  **Request:**Â The device receives the DHCPOFFER message and sends a DHCPREQUEST message to the DHCP server. The DHCPREQUEST message accepts the offer and requests the IP address.
4.  **Acknowledge:**Â The DHCP server receives the DHCPREQUEST message and sends a DHCPACK message to the device. The DHCPACK message acknowledges the request and assigns the IP address to the device.

The DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPOFFER, DHCPREQUEST, and DHCPACK messages are all UDP messages. UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means that there is no need to establish a connection between the DHCP client and the DHCP server before sending messages. This makes DHCP very efficient, as it does not require any additional resources.

The DHCP process is repeated whenever a device boots up or loses its IP address lease. The lease time is the amount of time that a device is allowed to use an IP address that has been assigned to it dynamically. When the lease time expires, the device must renew its lease from the DHCP server. If the device does not renew its lease, the DHCP server will assign the IP address to another device.

Scope
-----

A DHCP scope is a range of IP addresses that can be assigned by a DHCP server. A scope is defined by a network address, subnet mask, and lease time.

Exclusion ranges
----------------

Exclusion ranges are IP addresses that are not included in a DHCP scope. Exclusion ranges are used to prevent DHCP servers from assigning IP addresses to devices that should not be on the network.

Reservation
-----------

A DHCP reservation is a static assignment of an IP address to a specific device. Reservations are used to ensure that a particular device always gets the same IP address, even if the DHCP server is rebooted or the device is moved to a different network.

Dynamic assignment
------------------

Dynamic assignment is the process of assigning IP addresses to devices by a DHCP server. When a device boots up, it sends a DHCPDISCOVER message to the network. The DHCP server then sends a DHCPOFFER message to the device, offering it an IP address. The device then sends a DHCPREQUEST message to the DHCP server, accepting the offer.

Static assignment
-----------------

Static assignment is the process of manually assigning IP addresses to devices. Static assignment is used for devices that need to always have the same IP address, such as servers and printers.

Lease time
----------

A lease time is the amount of time that a device is allowed to use an IP address that has been assigned to it dynamically. When the lease time expires, the device must renew its lease from the DHCP server. If the device does not renew its lease, the DHCP server will assign the IP address to another device.

Scope options
-------------

Scope options are additional configuration information that can be assigned to devices by a DHCP server. Scope options can include things like the default gateway, DNS server addresses, and WINS server addresses.

Available leases
----------------

Available leases are IP addresses that are currently not in use by any devices. Available leases are stored in the DHCP server's lease database.

DHCP relay
----------

A DHCP relay agent is a device that forwards DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPREQUEST messages between a DHCP client and a DHCP server. DHCP relay agents are used in networks where the DHCP server is not located on the same subnet as the DHCP client.

IP helper/UDP forwarding
------------------------

IP helper/UDP forwarding is a feature that allows a router to forward DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPREQUEST messages to a DHCP server that is located on a different subnet. IP helper/UDP forwarding is used in networks where the DHCP server is not located on the same subnet as the DHCP client.

DNS
===

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates human-friendly domain names into the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.

Record types
------------

### Address (A vs. AAAA)

An A record is a type of DNS record that maps a domain name to an IPv4 address. An AAAA record is a type of DNS record that maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.

### Canonical name (CNAME)

A CNAME record is a type of DNS record that maps a domain name to another domain name. This is often used to create aliases for websites or email addresses.

### Mail exchange (MX)

An MX record is a type of DNS record that specifies the mail servers for a domain. This is used by email clients to deliver mail to the correct servers.

### Start of authority (SOA)

An SOA record is a type of DNS record that contains information about the domain name, such as the name server responsible for the domain and the email address of the domain administrator.

### Pointer (PTR)

A PTR record is a type of DNS record that maps an IP address to a domain name. This is used by reverse DNS lookups, which are used to identify the owner of an IP address.

### Text (TXT)

A TXT record is a type of DNS record that can be used to store arbitrary text data. This is often used to store information about the domain, such as the domain's description or keywords.

### Service (SRV)

An SRV record is a type of DNS record that specifies the location of a service, such as an email server or a web server. This is used by clients to connect to the correct servers.

### Name server (NS)

An NS record is a type of DNS record that specifies the name servers for a domain. This is used by clients to find the correct DNS servers for a domain.

Global hierarchy
----------------

The DNS global hierarchy is a system that organizes domain names into a tree-like structure. The top of the hierarchy is the root zone, which is managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Below the root zone are the top-level domains (TLDs), such as .com, .net, and .org. Each TLD is managed by a different organization.

A Second Level Domain is the part of the domain name that is located right before a Top Level Domain.

For example, inÂ `mozilla.org`Â the SLD isÂ `mozilla`Â and the TLD isÂ `org`.

A domain name is not limited to a TLD and an SLD. Additional subdomains can be created in order to provide additional information about various functions of a server or to delimit areas under the same domain. For example,Â `www`Â is a commonly used subdomain to indicate the domain points to a web server.

As another example, inÂ `developer.mozilla.org`, theÂ `developer`Â subdomain is used to specify that the subdomain contains the developer section of the Mozilla website.

### Root DNS servers

The root DNS servers are the servers that are responsible for the root zone. There are 13 root DNS servers located around the world. When a user types a domain name into a web browser, the browser sends a DNS query to the root DNS servers. The root DNS servers then return the IP address of the TLD server for the domain name.

<aside> ðŸ’¡ A common misconception is that there are only 13 root servers in the world. In reality there are many more, but still only 13 IP addresses used to query the different root server networks. Limitations in the original architecture of DNS require there to be a maximum of 13 server addresses in the root zone. In the early days of the Internet, there was only one server for each of the 13 IP addresses, most of which were located in the United States.

Today each of the 13 IP addresses has several servers, which useÂ Anycast routingÂ to distribute requests based on load and proximity. Right now there are over 600 different DNS root servers distributed across every populated continent on earth.

Internal vs. external
---------------------

**Internal DNS** is a DNS server that is used to resolve names within a private network. It is not accessible from the public internet. Internal DNS servers are typically used by businesses and organizations to manage their internal resources, such as file servers, printers, and web servers.

**External DNS** is a DNS server that is used to resolve names on the public internet. It is accessible from anywhere in the world. External DNS servers are typically used by businesses and organizations to host their websites and web applications.

The main difference between internal and external DNS is the scope of the names that they can resolve. Internal DNS can only resolve names within a private network, while external DNS can resolve names on the public internet.

Zone transfers
--------------

A DNS zone transfer is the process of copying the contents of a DNS zone file from one DNS server to another. Zone transfers are used to replicate DNS zones between primary and secondary DNS servers. This ensures that all DNS servers have the most up-to-date information about the domain names and IP addresses in a zone.

There are two types of zone transfers:

-   **Full zone transfer (AXFR):**Â This type of zone transfer copies the entire contents of a zone file from one DNS server to another.
-   **Incremental zone transfer (IXFR):**Â This type of zone transfer only copies the changes that have been made to a zone file since the last transfer.

Zone transfers are typically initiated by the secondary DNS server. The secondary DNS server sends a request to the primary DNS server for a zone transfer. The primary DNS server then sends the zone file to the secondary DNS server.

Zone transfers can be performed over either UDP or TCP. UDP is the default protocol for zone transfers. TCP is a more secure protocol, but it is also slower.

Zone transfers can be a security risk. If a malicious user is able to perform a zone transfer, they can gain access to sensitive information, such as IP addresses and domain names. To mitigate this risk, zone transfers should only be allowed from authorized IP addresses.

Here are some of the benefits of using DNS zone transfers:

Authoritative name servers
--------------------------

An authoritative name server (NS) is a name server that has the authority to answer queries about a specific domain name or subdomain. Authoritative name servers store the most recent and accurate information about the domain name, including its IP address and other DNS records.

When a user types a domain name into their web browser, their computer sends a query to a DNS server. The DNS server then queries the authoritative name server for the domain name to find the IP address of the website. The authoritative name server then returns the IP address to the DNS server, which then returns it to the user's computer.

There are two types of authoritative name servers: primary and secondary. A primary authoritative name server is the only server that can make changes to the DNS records for a domain name. A secondary authoritative name server is a backup server that stores a copy of the DNS records for a domain name.

Time to live (TTL)
------------------

Time to live (TTL) is a value that is associated with a resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies the amount of time that a DNS resolver should cache the resource record before it expires and needs to be refreshed.

The TTL is specified in seconds. For example, a TTL of 300 means that the DNS resolver will cache the resource record for 300 seconds (5 minutes). After 300 seconds, the DNS resolver will discard the cached resource record and request a new one from the authoritative name server.

The TTL is used to improve the performance of the DNS by reducing the number of requests that need to be made to the authoritative name servers. It also helps to prevent stale data from being cached.

DNS caching
-----------

DNS caching is a technique that is used to store the results of DNS queries in a temporary location, such as a computer's memory or a local server. This allows DNS resolvers to quickly return the results of queries for previously visited websites and other online resources.

When a user types a domain name into their web browser, their computer sends a query to a DNS resolver. The DNS resolver then queries the authoritative name server for the domain name to find the IP address of the website. The authoritative name server then returns the IP address to the DNS resolver, which then returns it to the user's computer.

If the DNS resolver has a cached copy of the DNS record for the domain name, it will return the IP address from the cache instead of querying the authoritative name server. This can significantly improve the performance of DNS lookups, as it eliminates the need to make a round trip to the authoritative name server.

DNS caching can be implemented on a variety of devices, including computers, routers, and firewalls. It is a valuable tool that can be used to improve the performance of DNS lookups and reduce the load on authoritative name servers.

Reverse DNS/reverse & lookup/forward lookup
-------------------------------------------

In the Domain Name System (DNS), a reverse lookup is a query that maps an IP address to a domain name. A forward lookup is the opposite, mapping a domain name to an IP address.

Reverse lookups are used for a variety of purposes, including:

-   **Spam filtering:**Â Reverse lookups can be used to identify spam servers. Spammers often use IP addresses that have no reverse lookup or that have a reverse lookup that points to a generic domain name.
-   **Fraud detection:**Â Reverse lookups can be used to identify fraudulent websites. Fraudulent websites often use IP addresses that have no reverse lookup or that have a reverse lookup that points to a generic domain name.
-   **Security:**Â Reverse lookups can be used to improve the security of a network. By requiring that all hosts on a network have a reverse lookup, it can be more difficult for attackers to hide their identity.

Forward lookups are used to resolve domain names to IP addresses. This is the most common use of DNS. When you type a domain name into your web browser, your computer sends a query to a DNS server to find the IP address of the website. The DNS server then returns the IP address to your computer, which then uses the IP address to connect to the website.

Forward lookups are also used for a variety of other purposes, including:

-   **Email:**Â Forward lookups are used to deliver email. When you send an email, your computer sends the email to a DNS server to find the IP address of the email server for the recipient's domain name. The DNS server then returns the IP address to your computer, which then uses the IP address to send the email to the recipient's email server.
-   **Name resolution:**Â Forward lookups are used to resolve names to other types of resources, such as file shares and printers. When you try to access a file share or printer by name, your computer sends a query to a DNS server to find the IP address of the resource. The DNS server then returns the IP address to your computer, which then uses the IP address to connect to the resource.

Recursive lookup/iterative lookup
---------------------------------

A recursive lookup is a DNS query in which the DNS server that receives the query is responsible for resolving the query to an IP address and returning the IP address to the client. The DNS server may query other DNS servers to resolve the query, but it is ultimately responsible for returning the IP address to the client.

An iterative lookup is a DNS query in which the DNS server that receives the query does not resolve the query to an IP address. Instead, the DNS server returns a referral to another DNS server that is more likely to be able to resolve the query. The client then sends the query to the referred DNS server, and the process repeats until the query is resolved.

Recursive lookups are typically used by clients that do not have their own DNS servers. Iterative lookups are typically used by clients that have their own DNS servers.
