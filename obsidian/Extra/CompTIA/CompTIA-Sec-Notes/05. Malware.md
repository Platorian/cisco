## Viruses
Malware that requires user action to spread.
10 Types:
- **Boot Sector**
	- Stored in the first sector of a hard disk or SSD and loaded into memory when the computer boots up
	- Difficult to detect by antivirus
	- To remove, need an antivirus that specifically searches for boot sector viruses
- **Macro**
	- Code that allows a virus to be embedded within another document, virus executes upon document opening. Not always malicious.
- **Program**
	- Infects executables or application files. Because of this tactic, can infect the user over and over again, each time they run that .exe or app
- **Multipartite**
	- Combination of boot sector type virus and a program virus. Higher persistence, even after removal.
- **Encrypted**
	- Hides itself from being detected by encrypting its malicious code or payloads, attempts to avoid antivirus software.
- **Polymorphic**
	- Advanced version of encrypted virus, but will change the virus's code each time it is executed by altering the decryption module, helps avoid detection by changing signature
- **Metamorphic**
	- Can rewrite itself entirely before it attempts to infect a given file
- **Stealth**
	- Technique
	- Avoiding detection by antivirus
- **Armor**
	- Have a layer of protection to confuse a program or person attempting to analyzing it
- **Hoax**
	- Isn't a virus, but social engineering technique that attempts a scare a user into taking undesirable action on their system

## Worms
Malware that propagates and replicates itself without user action.
Two concerns:
- Can infect your computer/system
- Can disrupt network traffic and computing resources because the worm is trying to replicate itself. Can even lead to DoS.
Notable worm:
- Conficker
	- 9-15M user affected
	- Targeted machines without a MS security patch to create a botnet

## Trojans
Malware that is disguised as harmless or desirable software.
**Remote Access Trojan:**
- Type of Trojan widely used, provides attacker with remote control of victim machine

## Ransomware
Malware that blocks access to a system or data until ransom is paid to the attacker.
Best practices to prevent:
- Conduct regular backups
- Install regular software updates
- Providing security awareness training
- Implementing Multi-factor authentication for the systems

## Botnets
Network of compromised computers controlled remotely by a malicious actor
**Zombies:**
- Compromised computer that is a part of a botnet or performing tasks using remote commands without user knowledge
**Command and Control Node:**
- Responsible for managing and coordinating the activities of other nodes within a network, particularly botnets
Uses:
- Storing illegal content
- Phishing campaigns
- Spreading malware
- DDoS
- Crypto-mining
- Breaking encryption schemes

## Rootkits
Malware that is designed to gain administrative-level control over a given computer system without detection.
Once access is gained, the attacker can:
- Install programs
- Delete programs
- Open ports
- Shut ports
- etc.
How it works:
- Aims to enter Ring 0 of OS (Kernel Mode) to gain highest level of permissions
Techniques:
- **DLL Injection:**
	- Used to run arbitrary code within the address space of another process by forcing it to load a dynamic-link library, adds persistence

## Backdoors
Used to bypass normal security and authentication functions. Resulting from terrible programming practices or Remote Access Trojans (RAT).

## Easter Egg
Insecure coding practice that was used by programmers to provide a joke or gag gift to users. Harmless, but increase the attack surface and aren't always security tested.

## Logic Bombs
Malicious code that is inserted into a program and will only execute when certain conditions are met.

## Keylogger
Piece of software or hardware that records every keystroke on a computer or mobile device.
Can lead to:
- Identity theft
- Financial Fraud
- Corporate Espionage
Preventing:
- Regular updates and patches
- Quality antivirus/antimalware solutions
- Phishing awareness training
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Encrypt keystrokes being sent to systems
- Physical checks of desktops/laptops/servers

## Spyware
Malware designed to gather and send information about a user/organization without their knowledge.
Installed by:
- Bundled with other software
- Malicious website
- Clicking on a deceptive pop-up ad

## Bloatware
Any software that comes preinstalled computer/phone that you didn't request or need. Uses up space and resources, and opens you up to more vulnerability.
To protect yourself:
- Manually remove bloatware that you do not use/need
- Use bloatware removal tools
- Perform a clean OS installation

## Malware Attack Techniques
**Fileless Malware:**
- Used to create a process in the system memory without relying on the local file system of the infected host.
- Leaves less evidence
Deployment Model:
- *Stage 1: Dropper or Downloader*
	- When a user clicks a malicious link or file, malware installs
	- **Dropper:**
		- Initiates or runs other malware forms within a payload on an infected host.
	- **Downloader:**
		- Retrieves additional tools post initial infection facilitated by the dropper
	- **Shell Code:**
		- Lightweight code meant to execute an exploit on a given target
- *Stage 2: Downloader*
	- Download and install RAT to conduct Command and Control on the victim system
- *'Actions on Objectives' Phase*
	- Threat actor will execute primary objectives to meet core objectives (could be data exfil or file encryption)
- *Concealment*
	- Helps prolong unauthorized access to the system by hiding tracks, erasing logs, and hiding any other evidence of malicious activities
Delivery Techniques:
- Code injection
	- Disguises itself by running in conjunction of a legitimate process
- Masquerading
- DLL Injection
- DLL Sideloading
- Process Hallowing
- 'Living off the Land'
	- Exploit standard system tools

## Indications of Malware Attacks
- Account Lockouts
- Concurrent Session Utilization
	- Each user should only have one session open at a time
- Blocked Content
- Impossible Travel
	- Logins from very geographically far locations
- Resource Consumption
- Resource Inaccessibility
- Out-of-Cycle Logging
	- Logins at odd hours
- Missing Logs
- Published or Documented Attacks
