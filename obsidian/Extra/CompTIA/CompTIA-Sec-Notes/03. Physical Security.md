## Fencing and Ballasts
Fence
- Visual deterrent
- Established physical barrier
- Delays intruders
Ballasts
- Shields pedestrians, buildings and assets
- Shows where vehicles aren't permitted

## Brute Force Attacks
Use high-strength, metal frame doors with deadbolts
Concerns:
- Confronting security personnel
- Climbing barriers
- Ramming barriers with cars

## Surveillance Systems
- Video
	- Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ)
- Security Guards
- Lighting
- Sensors
	- Infrared
	- Pressure
	- Microwave
	- Ultrasonic

## Bypassing Surveillance
- Visual Obstruction
- Blinding
- Interfering with Acoustics
- Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
- Physical Environment Attack
- *Countermeasures*
	- Anti-tampering alarms
	- Backup Power Supplies / Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS)
	- Encrypt Frequencies

## Access Control Vestibles
- Double Door System
	- Electronically-controlled
	- Allows for Authentication and Authorization
	- Prevents Piggybacking and Tailgating
- *Countermeasures*
	- RFID/NFC
	- Magnetic Strips
- Security Guards
	- Visual Deterrent
	- Assistance
	- Check Identity
	- Response

## Door Locks
- Padlocks and Door Locks are Easy to Pick
- Electronic Door Locks
	- Biometric Considerations
		- Unfortunately, will have a Fake Acceptance Rate (FAR), ideally to be at zero
		- False Rejection Rate (FRR)
		- Equal Error Rate (EER) or Crossover Error Rate (CER) that measures systems' effectiveness and balance
			- Lower of these values the better

## Access Badge Cloning
Scanning Considerations
- RFID or NFC reader can be used to steal data and duplicate a new card or fob
Countermeasures:
- Implement Advanced Encryption in Card-Based Systems
- MFA Authentication
- Regular Security Updates
- Educate Users
- Shielded Wallets or Sleeves
- Monitor/Audit Access Logs
