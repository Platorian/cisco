## Risk Assessment Frequency
The regularity of which risk assessments are conducted.
#### Ad-Hoc
Conducted as and when needed, often in response to an event that has potential to introduce new risks or changing nature of existing risks. May be repeated.
#### Recurring
Conducted at regular intervals.
#### One-Time
Conducted for a specific purpose, not repeated.
#### Continuous
Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of risk.

## Risk Identification
Crucial first step in risk assessment. Often followed by a business impact analysis.
#### Business Impact Analysis
Process that involves evaluating the potential effects of disruption to an organization's business functions and processes.
###### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
Represents the maximum acceptable length of time that can elapse before the lack of business function severely impacts the organization.
###### Recovery Point Objective
Represents maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.
###### Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
Represents the average time required to repair a failed component or system. Lower MTTR is a more repairable system.
###### Mean Time Between Repairs
Represents the average time between failures. Measure of reliability.

## Risk Register
A key tool in risk management, featuring key risk indicators, risk owners, and risk thresholds. A document detailing identified risks, including their description, impact likelihood, and mitigation strategies. May resemble a heat map matrix.
#### Risk Description
Entails identifying and providing a detailed description of the risk.
#### Risk Outcome
Result of a risk, linked to its impact and likelihood.
#### Risk Impact
Potential consequences if risk materializes. Usually on a scale.
#### Risk Level/Threshold
Determined by combining the impact and likelihood.
#### Risk Likelihood
Chance of particular risk occurring.
#### Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
Essential predictive metrics used by organizations to signal rising risk levels in different parts of the enterprise. Allows for proactive risk management, preventing escalation.
#### Risk Owner
Person or group responsible for managing the risk.
#### Cost
Pertains to its financial impact on the project, including potential expenses if it occurs or the cost of its mitigation.
## Risk Tolerance/Risk Acceptance
The organization's or individual's willingness to deal with uncertainty in pursuit of their goals.
## Risk Appetite
Organization's willingness to embrace or retain specific types and levels of risk to fulfill its strategic goals.
#### Expansionary Risk Appetite
Open to taking more risk in the hopes of achieving greater returns.
#### Conservative Risk Appetite
Implies organization favors less risk, even if it leads to lower returns.
#### Neutral Risk Appetite
Signifies balance between risk and return.

## Qualitative Risk Analysis
Method of assessing risk based on their potential impact and the likelihood of their occurrence.

## Quantitative Risk Analysis
More objective and numerical risk assessment.
#### Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
Monetary value expected to be lost in a single event. Calculated by asset times exposure factor (EF):
- $100,000 (Asset) * 70% EF = $70,000 SLE
- *Asset x EF = SLE*
#### Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
Estimated frequency with which a threat is expected to occur within  a year.
#### Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
Expected annual loss from a risk. Calculated by:
- *SLE x ARO*
#### Exposure Factor (EF)
Proportion of an asset that is lost in an event. Recorded as:
- 0% (No loss)
- 100% (total loss)
- Examples:
	- HQ Flooding = 70% lost assets
	- EF = 70%

## Risk Management Strategies
#### Risk Transference (Risk Sharing)
Involves shifting the risk from the organization to another party.
###### Contract Indemnity Clause
A contractual agreement where one party agrees to cover the other's harm, liability, or loss stemming from the contract.
#### Risk Acceptance
Recognizing a risk and choosing to address it when it arises.
###### Exemption
Rule that grants an exception from a specific rule or requirement.
###### Exception
Permits a party to bypass a rule or requirement under specific circumstances.
#### Risk Avoidance
Strategy of altering plans or approaches to completely eliminate a specific risk.
#### Risk Mitigation
Implementing measures to decrease the likelihood or impact of a risk.

## Risk Monitoring and Reporting
Involves continuously tracking identified risks, assessing new risks, executing response plans, and evaluating their effectiveness during a project's life cycle, and communicating that information.
- Informed decision-making
- Risk mitigation
- Stakeholder communication
- Regulatory Compliance
#### Residual Risk
Likelihood and impact after implementing mitigation, transference, or acceptance measures on the initial risk.
#### Control Risk
Assessment of how a security measure has lost effectiveness over time.
