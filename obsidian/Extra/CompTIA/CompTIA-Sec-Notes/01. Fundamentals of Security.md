## Our Goal
*Convenience vs. Security;* Finding that sweet spot!

## InfoSec
The act of protecting data and information from unauthorized access, modification, disruption, disclosure, corruption, and destruction.

## Information System Security
The act of protecting devices holding data.

## CIA Triad + 2
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
- Non-repudiation
- Authentication

## AAA of Security
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Accounting
	- Tracking of user activities and resource usage (auditing and billing)

## Zero Trust
Security model/principle that no one, inside or outside of the organization, should be trusted by default
- *Control Plane:*
	- Adaptive identity, threat scope reduction, policy-driven access control and secured zones
- *Data plane:*
	- Focused on the subject or system, policy engine, policy admin, and policy enforcement points
