In this course you will learn:

- the universal concepts of computer programming;
- the syntax and semantics of the Python language;
- practical skills in resolving typical implementation challenges;
- how to use the most important elements of the Python Standard Library;
- how to install your runtime environment;
- how to design, develop, test, and debug simple Python programs.

The course is divided into four modules:

1. **Module 1**  
    Introduction to Python and computer programming;
2. **Module 2**  
    Data types, variables, basic input-output operations, and basic operators;
3. **Module 3**  
    Boolean values, conditional execution, loops, lists and list processing, logical and bitwise operations;
4. **Module 4**  
    Functions, tuples, dictionaries, exceptions, and data processing.

A complete set of known commands is called an **instruction list**, sometimes abbreviated to **IL.** Different types of computers may vary depending on the size of their ILs, and the instructions could be completely different in different models.

We need a language in which humans can write their programs and a language that computers may use to execute the programs, one that is far more complex than machine language and yet far simpler than natural language.

Such languages are often called high-level programming languages. They are at least somewhat similar to natural ones in that they use symbols, words and conventions readable to humans. These languages enable humans to express commands to computers that are much more complex than those offered by ILs.

A program written in a high-level programming language is called a **source code** (in contrast to the machine code executed by computers). Similarly, the file containing the source code is called the **source file**.

There are two different ways of **transforming a program from a high-level programming language into machine language**:

There are very few languages that can be both compiled and interpreted. Usually, a programming language is projected with this factor in its constructors' minds â€“ will it be compiled or interpreted?
