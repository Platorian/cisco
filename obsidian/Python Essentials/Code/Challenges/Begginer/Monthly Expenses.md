John has a list of his monthly expenses from last year:

monthly_spending = [2689.56, 2770.38, 2394.04, 2099.91, 3182.20, 3267.12, 1746.83, 2545.72, 3328.20, 3147.30, 2462.61, 3890.45]

He wants to know his average expenses for each semester. Using a `for` loop, calculate Johnâ€™s average expenses for the first semester (January to June) and the second semester (July to December).

We can use enumerate to tack the position
We can then use an if clause to break up the list at the halfway point, 6 months.

```python
monthly_spending = [2689.56, 2770.38, 2394.04, 2099.91, 3182.20, 3267.12, 1746.83, 2545.72, 3328.20, 3147.30, 2462.61, 3890.45]

first_semester = 0
second_semester = 0

for index, value in enumerate(monthly_expenses):
	if index < 6:
		first_semester += value
	else:
		second_semester += value

first_sem_avg = first_semester / 6
second_sem_avg = second_semester / 6

print(f"Your First Semester Average is: {first_sem_average}")
print(f"Your Second Semester Average is: {second_sem_average}")
```

sam_monthly_spending = [1969.62, 3939.37, 2241.59, 3968.27, 3068.80, 1755.02, 3885.66, 2491.67, 3828.49, 3171.32, 2771.32, 3380.37]

```python
john_monthly_spending = [2689.56, 2770.38, 2394.04, 2099.91, 3182.20, 3267.12, 1746.83, 2545.72, 3328.20, 3147.30, 2462.61, 3890.45]
 
sam_monthly_spending = [1969.62, 3939.37, 2241.59, 3968.27, 3068.80, 1755.02, 3885.66, 2491.67, 3828.49, 3171.32, 2771.32, 3380.37]

months_john_spent_more = 0
 
for i in range(len(john_monthly_spending)):
    if john_monthly_spending[i] > sam_monthly_spending[i]:
        months_john_spent_more += 1
 
print("Number of months John spent more money than Sam:", months_john_spent_more)
```

**Explanation**

We initialise the variable `months_john_spent_more` with the value zero. Then we use a for loop with `range(len())` to iterate over the indices of the `john_monthly_spending` list.

Within the loop, we compare John's expenses with Sam's expenses for the corresponding month using the index `i`. If John's expenses are greater than Sam's for a particular month, we increment the `months_john_spent_more` variable. Finally, we print out the total number of months where John spent more money than Sam.
