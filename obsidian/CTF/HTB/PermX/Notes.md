**Target:**
```php
10.10.11.23
```

Nmap reveals port 80 with a webpage.

Gobuster doesn't find any directories so i try a subdomain search and find `lms`

I add both addresses to the host file:
`permx.htb` and `lms.perx.htb`

This takes me to a login page.

Wappalyzer shows php as one of the services as well as apache which lines up with the namp scan. 

I try telling the app that i lost my password for user admin, which gives me a possible username:
`This platform was unable to send the email. Please contact [Davis Miller](mailto:admin@permx.htb) for more information.`

Find robot.txt with gobuster on the lms subdomain

```php
# robots.txt
User-Agent: *
# Directories
Disallow: /app/
Disallow: /bin/
Disallow: /documentation/
Disallow: /home/
Disallow: /main/
Disallow: /plugin/
