# Intro
Log analysis is an essential aspect of cyber security and system monitoring. At a high level, log analysis examines and interprets log event data generated by various sources (devices, applications, and systems) to monitor metrics and identify security incidents. It involves collecting, parsing, and processing log files to turn data into actionable objectives. By adopting an effective log analysis strategy, security teams can more accurately respond to security incidents and gain proactive insights into potential threats.

In this room, we will explore concepts related to log analysis methodology, effective logging practices, and common tools to aid detection and response.
