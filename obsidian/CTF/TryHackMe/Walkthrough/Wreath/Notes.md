Thomas has sent over the following information about the network:

_There are two machines on my home network that host projects and stuff I'm working on in my own time -- one of them has a webserver that's port forwarded, so that's your way in if you can find a vulnerability! It's serving a website that's pushed to my git server from my own PC for version control, then cloned to the public facing server. See if you can get into these! My own PC is also on that network, but I doubt you'll be able to get into that as it has protections turned on, doesn't run anything vulnerable, and can't be accessed by the public-facing section of the network. Well, I say PC -- it's technically a repurposed server because I had a spare license lying around, but same difference.

From this we can take away the following pieces of information:

- There are three machines on the network
- There is at least one public facing webserver
- There is a self-hosted git server somewhere on the network
- The git server is internal, so Thomas may have pushed sensitive information into it  
- There is a PC running on the network that has antivirus installed, meaning we can hazard a guess that this is likely to be Windows
- By the sounds of it this is likely to be the server variant of Windows, which might work in our favour  
- The (assumed) Windows PC cannot be accessed directly from the webserver

There are five possible ways to enumerate a network through a compromised host:

1. Using material found on the machine. The hosts file or ARP cache, for example  
2. Using pre-installed tools  
3. Using statically compiled tools
4. Using scripting techniques
5. Using local tools through a proxy

_The difference between a "static" binary and a "dynamic" binary is in the compilation. Most programs use a variety of external libraries (_`.so` _files on Linux, or_ `.dll` _files on Windows) -- these are referred to as "dynamic" programs. Static programs are compiled with these libraries built into the finished executable file. When we're trying to use the binary on a target system we will nearly always need a statically compiled copy of the program, as the system may not have the dependencies installed meaning that a dynamic binary would be unable to run._
