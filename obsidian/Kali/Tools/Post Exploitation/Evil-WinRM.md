## Documentation

### Clear text password
If you don't want to put the password in clear text, you can optionally avoid to set `-p` argument and the password will be prompted preventing to be shown.

### Ipv6
To use IPv6, the address must be added to /etc/hosts. Just put the already set name of the host after `-i` argument instead of an IP address.

### Basic commands
 - **upload**: local files can be auto-completed using tab key.
   - usage: `upload local_filename` or `upload local_filename destination_filename`
 - **download**:
   - usage: `download remote_filename` or `download remote_filename destination_filename`

 __Notes about paths (upload/download)__:
   Relative paths are not allowed to use on download/upload. Use filenames on current directory or absolute path.
   If you are using Evil-WinRM in a docker environment, bear in mind that all local paths should be at `/data` and be pretty sure that you mapped it as a volume in order to be able to access to downloaded files or to be able to upload files from your local host O.S.

 - **services**: list all services showing if there your account has permissions over each one. No administrator permissions needed to use this feature.
 - **menu**: load the `Invoke-Binary`, `Dll-Loader` and `Donut-Loader` functions that we will explain below. When a ps1 is loaded all its functions will be shown up.

```

### Load powershell scripts
 - To load a ps1 file you just have to type the name (auto-completion using tab allowed). The scripts must be in the path set at `-s` argument. Type menu again and see the loaded functions. Very large files can take a long time to be loaded.

### Kerberos
 - First you have to sync date with the DC: `rdate -n <dc_ip>`

 - To generate ticket there are many ways:

   * Using [ticketer.py] from impacket
   * If you get a kirbi ticket using [Rubeus] or [Mimikatz] you have to convert to ccache using [ticket_converter.py]

 - Add ccache ticket. There are 2 ways:

    `export KRB5CCNAME=/foo/var/ticket.ccache`

    `cp ticket.ccache /tmp/krb5cc_0`

 - Add realm to `/etc/krb5.conf` (for linux). Use of this format is important:

   ```
    CONTOSO.COM = {
                kdc = fooserver.contoso.com
    }
   ```

 - Check Kerberos tickets with `klist`
 - To remove ticket use: `kdestroy`
 - For more information about Kerberos check this [cheatsheet]

### Remote path completion
This feature could be not available depending of the ruby you are using. It must be compiled with readline support. Otherwise, this feature will not work (a warning will be shown).

#### Method 1 (compile the needed extension)

Using this method you'll compile ruby with the needed readline feature but to use only the library without changing the default ruby version on your system. Because of this, is the most recommended method.

Let's suppose that you have in your Debian based system ruby 2.7.3:

```
# Install needed package
apt install libreadline-dev

# Check your ruby version
ruby --version
ruby 2.7.3p183 (2021-04-05 revision 6847ee089d) [x86_64-linux-gnu]

# Download ruby source code (2.7.3 in this case):
wget https://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.7/ruby-2.7.3.tar.gz

# Extract source code
tar -xf ruby-2.7.3.tar.gz

# Compile the readline extension:
cd ruby-2.7.3/ext/readline
ruby ./extconf.rb
make

# Patch current version of the ruby readline extension:
sudo cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ruby/2.7.0/readline.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ruby/2.7.0/readline.so.bk
sudo cp -f readline.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ruby/2.7.0/readline.so
```

#### Method 2 (Install ruby to use it only for evil-winrm using rbenv)

Let's suppose that you want ruby 2.7.1 on a Debian based Linux and you are using zsh. This script will automatize it. You'll need to launch it from the same dir where evil-winrm.rb and Gemfile is located (the evil-winrm created dir after a git clone for example):

```
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

# Uninstall possible current installed versions
sudo gem uninstall evil-winrm -q
gem uninstall evil-winrm -q

# Install rbenv
sudo apt install rbenv

# Config rbenv on zshrc config file
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Install ruby with readline support
export RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS=--with-readline-dir="/usr/include/readline"
rbenv install 2.7.1

# Create file '.ruby-version' to set right ruby version
rbenv local 2.7.1

# Install local gems
gem install bundler
bundle install

current_evwr="$(pwd)/evil-winrm.rb"

sudo bash -c "cat << 'EOF' > /usr/bin/evil-winrm
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    "${current_evwr}" "\$@"
EOF"

sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/evil-winrm
```

Then you can safely launch evil-winrm using the new installed ruby with the required readline support from any location.

#### Method 3 (compile entire ruby)

If you want to compile it yourself, you can follow these steps. Let's suppose that you want ruby 2.7.3:

```
wget -O ruby-install-0.8.1.tar.gz https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install/archive/v0.8.1.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ruby-install-0.8.1.tar.gz
cd ruby-install-0.8.1/
sudo make install
ruby-install ruby 2.7.3 -- --with-readline-dir=/usr/include/readline
```
Depending of your system it will be installed at `/opt/rubies/ruby-2.7.3` or maybe at ` ~/.rubies/ruby-2.7.3`.

Now just need to install evil-winrm dependencies for that new installed ruby version. The easiest way is to launch command `/opt/rubies/ruby-2.7.3/bin/gem install evil-winrm`. The gem command used must be belonging to the new ruby installation.

After that, you can launch safely your new installed ruby to use it on evil-winrm: `/opt/rubies/ruby-2.7.3/bin/ruby ./evil-winrm.rb -h`

It is recommended to use this new installed ruby only to launch evil-winrm. If you set it up as your default ruby for your system, bear in mind that it has no dependency gems installed. Some ruby based software like Metasploit or others could not start correctly due dependencies problems.

### Logging
This feature will create files on your $HOME dir saving commands and the outputs of the WinRM sessions
