Other ISP connection options for home users include the following:

> Cellular 

Cellular internet access uses a cell phone network to connect. Wherever you can get a cellular signal, you can get cellular internet access. Performance will be limited by the capabilities of the phone and the cell tower to which it is connected. The availability of cellular internet access is a real benefit for people in areas that would otherwise have no internet connectivity at all, or for people who are constantly on the move. The downside of cellular connectivity is that the carrier usually meters the bandwidth usage of the connection and may charge extra for bandwidth that exceeds the contract data plan.

> Satalite

Satellite service is a good option for homes or offices that do not have access to DSL or cable. Satellite dishes (see figure) require a clear line of sight to the satellite and so might be difficult in heavily wooded areas or places with other overhead obstructions. Speeds will vary depending on the contract, though they are generally good. Equipment and installation costs can be high (although check the provider for special deals), with a moderate monthly fee thereafter. Like cellular access, the availability of satellite internet access is a real benefit in areas that would otherwise have no internet connectivity at all.

> Dial-Up Telephone 

An inexpensive option that uses any phone line and a modem. To connect to the ISP, a user calls the ISP access phone number. The low bandwidth provided by a dial-up modem connection is usually not sufficient for large data transfer, although it is useful for mobile access while traveling. A modem dial-up connection should only be considered when higher speed connection options are not available.

In metropolitan areas, many apartments and small offices are being connected directly with fiber-optic cables. This enables an internet service provider to provide higher bandwidth speeds and support more services such as internet, phone, and TV.

The choice of connection varies depending on geographical location and service provider availability.
