The network devices that people are most familiar with are called end devices, or hosts. These devices form the interface between users and the underlying communication network.

Some examples of end devices are as follows:

- Computers (workstations, laptops, file servers, web servers)
- Network printers
- Telephones and teleconferencing equipment
- Security cameras
- Mobile devices (such as smart phones, tablets, PDAs, and wireless debit/credit card readers and barcode scanners)

An end device (or host) is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network, as shown in the animation. In order to uniquely identify hosts, addresses are used. When a host initiates communication, it uses the address of the destination host to specify where the message should be sent.
