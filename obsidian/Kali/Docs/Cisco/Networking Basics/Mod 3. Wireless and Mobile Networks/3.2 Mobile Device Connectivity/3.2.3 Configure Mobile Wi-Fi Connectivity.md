If your mobile device does not prompt to connect to a Wi-Fi network, the network SSID broadcast may be turned off, or the device may not be set to connect automatically. Manually configure the Wi-Fi settings on the mobile device. Remember that SSIDs and passphrases must be typed exactly as entered on the wireless router setup or the device will not connect properly, as shown in the figure. SSID is the name assigned to a wireless network. Passphrase is what we normally use as the “wireless password”.
