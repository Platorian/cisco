Mobile devices connect using many different methods. Cellular and Wi-Fi can be difficult to configure, and require extra equipment such as towers and access points. Cable connections are not always practical when connecting headsets or speakers. Bluetooth technology provides a simple way for mobile devices to connect to each other and to wireless accessories. Bluetooth is wireless, automatic, and uses very little power, which helps conserve battery life. Up to eight Bluetooth devices can be connected together at any one time.

These are some examples of how devices use Bluetooth:

- **Hands-free headset** - A small earpiece with a microphone can be used for making and receiving calls.
- **Keyboard or mouse** - A keyboard or mouse can be connected to a mobile device to make input easier.
- **Stereo control** - A mobile device can connect to a home or car stereo to play music.
- **Car speakerphone** - A device that contains a speaker and a microphone can be used for making and receiving calls.
- **Tethering** - A mobile device can connect to another mobile device or computer to share a network connection. Tethering can also be performed with a Wi-Fi connection or a cable connection such as USB.
- **Mobile speaker** - Portable speakers can connect to mobile devices to provide high-quality audio without a stereo system.
