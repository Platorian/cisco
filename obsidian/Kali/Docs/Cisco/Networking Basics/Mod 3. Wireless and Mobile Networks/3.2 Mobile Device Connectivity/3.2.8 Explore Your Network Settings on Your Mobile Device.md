Now that you have reviewed the steps to configure and verify your Wi-Fi, cellular, and Bluetooth access, explore these settings on your own phone. If you have access to a Bluetooth device, like headphones or a speaker, connect it to your phone. Notice that you can be using all three of these wireless services simultaneously, each serving a different role. You could be listening to music (Bluetooth), researching on the internet (Wi-Fi), and receiving text messages (cellular).
