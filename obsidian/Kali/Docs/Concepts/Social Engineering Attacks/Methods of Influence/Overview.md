**Protego Security Solutions**

The key to creating successful social engineering exploits is understanding human behavior and motivation. In social engineering attacks, we need to convince our targets to take actions that they would otherwise not take.

So what motivates people? What tricks can we use in our attempts to gain information about our clients’ networks? How can we make people commit risky behaviors that benefit us as we conduct are tests?

From what we gathered in our interviews with our Pixel Paradise stakeholders, Pixel Paradise has never conducted security awareness training with its staff. We think it will be pretty easy to deceive them with some of our social engineering attacks. Our goal here is convince Pixel Paradise that is essential that they conduct security awareness training. In addition, we will use the information that we gather to perform further exploits as part of the engagement.

> **Authority***

A social engineer shows confidence and perhaps authority–whether legal, organizational, or social authority.

> **Scarcity and Urgency***

It is possible to use scarcity to create a feeling of urgency in a decision-making context. Specific language can be used to heighten urgency and manipulate the victim. Salespeople often use scarcity to manipulate clients (for example, telling a customer that an offer is only for today or that there are limited supplies). Social engineers use similar techniques.

> **Social Proof***

Social proof is a psychological phenomenon in which an individual is not able to determine the appropriate mode of behavior. For example, you might see others acting or doing something in a certain way and might assume that it is appropriate. Social engineers may take advantage of social proof when an individual enters an unfamiliar situation that he or she doesn’t know how to deal with. Social engineers may manipulate multiple people at once by using this technique.

> **Likeness***

Individuals can be influenced by things or people they like. Social engineers strive for others to like the way they behave, look, and talk. Most individuals like what is aesthetically pleasing. People also like to be appreciated and to talk about themselves. Social engineers take advantage of these human vulnerabilities to manipulate their victims.

> **Fear***

It is possible to manipulate a person with fear to prompt him or her to act promptly. Fear is an unpleasant emotion based on the belief that something bad or dangerous may take place. Using fear, social engineers force their victims to act quickly to avoid or rectify a dangerous or painful situation.

Practice - Methods of Influence

You have been asked to participate in a social engineering campaign in the Pixel Paradise test. You are required to compose email messages and call scripts to be used in the campaign. This involves developing strategies to influence employees to visit a website that is infected with BeEF hook.js scripts. Match each of the methods of influence to how you would use it.
