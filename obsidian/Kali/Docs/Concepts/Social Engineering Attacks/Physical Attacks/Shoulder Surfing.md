With **_shoulder surfing_**, someone obtains information such as personally identifiable information (PII), passwords, and other confidential data by looking over a victimâ€™s shoulder. One way to do this is to get close to a person and look over his or her shoulder to see what the person is typing on a laptop, phone, or tablet. It is also possible to carry out this type of attack from far away by using binoculars or even a telescope. These attacks tend to be especially successful in crowded places. In addition, shoulder surfing can be accomplished with small hidden cameras and microphones. User awareness and training are key to prevention. There are also special screen filters for computer displays to prevent someone from seeing the screen at an angle.
