Attackers can perform different **_badge cloning attacks_**. For example, an attacker can clone a badge/card used to access a building. Specialized software and hardware can be used to perform these cloning attacks. Attackers can also use social engineering techniques to impersonate employees or any other authorized users to enter a building by just creating their own badge and attempting to trick other users into letting them into a building. This could even be done without a full clone of the radio frequency (RF) capabilities of a badge.

**TIP** Attackers can often obtain detailed information about the design (look and feel) of corporate badges from social media websites such as Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn, when people post photos showing their badges when they get new jobs or leave old ones.
