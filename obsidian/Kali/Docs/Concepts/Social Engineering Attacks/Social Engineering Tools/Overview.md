There are some excellent exploitation toolkits available in your Kali distribution. For example, we use both the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) and the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) in our customer engagements.

I think you will enjoy learning about these tools, and we have some lab experiences in which you can try them out. The tools are so versatile and comprehensive that we can only scratch the surface. I encourage you to study them on your own to learn more about what they can do.
