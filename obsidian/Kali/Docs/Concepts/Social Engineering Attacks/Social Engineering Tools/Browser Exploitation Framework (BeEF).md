In Module 6, “Exploiting Application-Based Vulnerabilities,” you will learn about web application vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). XSS vulnerabilities leverage input validation weaknesses on a web application. These vulnerabilities are often used to redirect users to malicious websites to steal cookies (session tokens) and other sensitive information. **_Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)_** is a tool that can be used to manipulate users by leveraging XSS vulnerabilities. You can download BeEF from [_https://beefproject.com_](https://beefproject.com) or [_https://github.com/beefproject/beef_](https://github.com/beefproject/beef).

Select each tab for an example of using the BeEF tool.

****Launching BeEF****

Figure 4-12 shows a screenshot of BeEF. The tool starts a web service on port 3000 by default. From there, the attacker can log in to a web console and manipulate users who are victims of XSS attacks.

****Stealing a Browser Cookie****

Figure 4-13 shows a successful compromise in which the attacker has stolen the user’s session token (browser cookie).

****Sending a Fake Notification****

Once the system is compromised, the attacker can use BeEF to perform numerous attacks (including social engineering attacks). For example, the attacker can send fake notifications to the victim’s browser, as demonstrated in Figure 4-14.

****Fake Notification in Browser****

Figure 4-15 shows the fake notification displayed in the victim’s browser.

Practice - Browser Exploitation Framework

In the Pixel Paradise penetration test, Protego will use BeEF as part of an exploitation campaign. How could BeEF be used?

Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) is a tool that can be used to manipulate users by sending false notification messages to compromised browsers. These notifications can be used to redirect users to malicious websites. Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) is a tool that can be used to launch numerous social engineering attacks, such as spear phishing emails. It also creates malware-infected USB drives to be distributed in or near a facility. Asterisk is a legitimate VOIP management tool that can be used to spoof caller ID.
