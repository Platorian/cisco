**_Vishing_** (which is short for _voice phishing_) is a social engineering attack carried out in a phone conversation. The attacker persuades the user to reveal private personal and financial information or information about another person or a company.

The goal of vishing is typically to steal credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and other information that can be used in identity theft schemes. Attackers may impersonate and spoof caller ID to hide themselves when performing vishing attacks.
