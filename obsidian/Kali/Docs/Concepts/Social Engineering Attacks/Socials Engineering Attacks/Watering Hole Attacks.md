A **_watering hole attack_** is a targeted attack that occurs when an attacker profiles websites that the intended victim accesses. The attacker then scans those websites for possible vulnerabilities. If the attacker locates a website that can be compromised, the website is then injected with a JavaScript or other similar code injection that is designed to redirect the user when the user returns to that site. (This redirection is also known as a _pivot attack_.) The user is then redirected to a site with some sort of exploit code. The purpose is to infect computers in the organization’s network, thereby allowing the attacker to gain a foothold in the network for espionage or other reasons.

Watering hole attacks are often designed to profile users of specific organizations. Organizations should therefore develop policies to prevent these attacks. Such a policy might, for example, require updating anti-malware applications regularly and using secure virtual browsers that have little connectivity to the rest of the system and the rest of the network. To avoid having a website compromised as part of such an attack, an administrator should use proper programming methods and scan the organization’s website for malware regularly. User education is paramount to help prevent these types of attacks.

Practice - Pivot Attack

During initial interviews and surveys of Pixel Paradise's employees, we discovered that they had already experienced all of the following social engineering attacks. Which one is a pivot attack?

**A watering hole, or pivot attack, is targeted when an attacker profiles websites the intended victim accesses. The attacker then scans those websites for possible vulnerabilities. Suppose the attacker locates a website that can be compromised. In that case, the website is then injected with a JavaScript or similar code injection designed to redirect the user when the user returns to that site.**

Practice - Social Engineering Attacks

Following our initial interviews with employees and other stakeholders at Pixel Paradise, it is important that we properly classify the types of social engineering attacks that they have experienced. This helps us to create targeted mitigation recommendations that suit the specific client. To practice this skill, match the description of the social engineering attack to the type of attack.
