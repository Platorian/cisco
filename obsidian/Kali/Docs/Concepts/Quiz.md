**Q.** Which are two best practices used to secure APIs? (Choose two.)

**A.** The following are several general best practices and recommendations for securing APIs:  

- Secure API services to provide HTTPS endpoints with only a strong version of TLS.
- Validate parameters in the application and sanitize incoming data from API clients.
- Explicitly scan for common attack signatures; injection attacks often betray themselves by following common patterns.
- Use strong authentication and authorization standards.
- Use reputable and standard libraries to create the APIs.
- Segment API implementation and API security into distinct tiers; doing so frees up the API developer to focus completely on the application domain.
- Identify what data should be publicly available and what information is sensitive.
- If possible, have a security expert do the API code verification.
- Make internal API documentation mandatory.
- Avoid discussing company API development (or any other application development) on a public forum.

**Q.** Which type of threat actors use cybercrime attacks to promote what they believe in?

**A.** Hacktivists are types of threat actors not motivated by money. Hacktivists are looking to make a point or to promote what they believe, using cybercrime as a method of attack. These types of attacks are often carried out by stealing sensitive data and then revealing it to the public to embarrass or financially affect a target.

**Q.** company conducted a penetration test 6 months ago. However, they have acquired new firewalls and servers to strengthen the network and increase capacity. Why would an administrator request a new penetration test?

**A.** Implementing a firewall, an IPS, anti-malware, a VPN, a web application firewall (WAF), and other modern security defenses is not enough. The validity of these defensive techniques needs to be tested regularly. As networks and systems change, the attack surface can vary as well, and when it does, the reevaluation of the security posture must be conducted by way of a penetration test.

**Q.** A network administrator performs a penetration test for a company that sells computer parts through an online storefront. The first step is to discover who owns the domain name that the company is using. Which penetration testing tool can be used to do this?

**A.** The **whois** command can gather information about who owns a particular domain from public records.

**Q.** A penetration tester wants to quickly discover all the live hosts on the 192.168.0.0/24 network. Which command can do the ping sweep using the nmap tool?

**A.** The command **nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24** is used to do a ping sweep of the 192.168.0.0/24 network for active hosts. This basic host discovery scan can be performed to determine what devices on a network are live. Such a scan for host discovery of an entire subnet is sometimes called a ping sweep.

**Q.** A penetration tester runs the command **nmap -sF -p 80 192.168.1.1** against a Windows host and receives a response RST packet. What conclusion can be drawn on the status of port 80?

**A.** A TCP FIN scan is not useful when scanning Windows-based systems, as they respond with RST packets, regardless of the port state. The normal implication of an RST message would indicate a closed port. Since this is a Windows-based system, it will always respond with an RST message regardless of the port state.

**Q.** Which common tool is used by penetration testers to craft packets?

**A.** Scapy is a very comprehensive Python-based framework or ecosystem for packet generation. Scapy must be run with root permissions to be able to modify packets.

---

**Q.** Why should a tester use query throttling techniques when running an authorized penetration test on a live network?

**A.** To work around the issue of bandwidth limitations and vulnerability scanning, slowing down the traffic created by the scanner can help. This is often referred to as query throttling, and it can typically be achieved by modifying the options of the scanning policy. One way to do this is to reduce the number of attack threads being sent to the target simultaneously.

**Q.** Why would an organization hire a red team?

**A.** A read team is a group of cybersecurity experts and penetration testers hired by an organization to mimic a real threat actor by exposing vulnerabilities and risks regarding technology, people, and physical security.
