A **_command injection_** is an attack in which an attacker tries to execute commands that he or she is not supposed to be able to execute on a system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application does not validate data supplied by the user (for example, data entered in web forms, cookies, HTTP headers, and other elements). The vulnerable system passes that data into a system shell.

With command injection, an attacker tries to send operating system commands so that the application can execute them with the privileges of the vulnerable application.

Command injection against web applications is not as popular as it used to be because modern application frameworks have better defenses against these attacks. Figure 6-14 shows an example of command injection using the intentionally vulnerable DVWA application.

In Figure 6-14, the website allows a user to enter an IP address to perform a ping test to that IP address, but the attacker enters the string **192.168.78.6;cat /etc/passwd** to cause the application to show the contents of the file **/etc/passwd**.
