Part of testing a web application is checking for various injection vulnerabilities. A good place to look is any web page that accepts user input, such as login credentials, contact us response forms, forum post forms, etc. Input forms provide a way to get malicious code into systems. Sometimes the code will affect a single web page. Other times, the injected code may give access to privileged information that is stored in databases. We plan to challenge various web forms and login boxes that we have discovered on the Pixel Paradise site.

Hopefully, the web application coders at Pixel Paradise taken measures against injection vulnerabilities in their web application by creating filters that neutralize these threats. These measures include either sanitizing malicious elements from the input text or completely rejecting any potentially hazardous input. Part of testing for code injection vulnerabilities is challenging this type of defense.

A really dangerous type of attack involves injecting SQL statements to exploit databases. In order to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities, you need to have a good knowledge of SQL. You will focus on increasing your familiarity with SQL and then investigate other types of attacks in preparation for this phase of our penetration test.

An attacker takes advantage of code injection vulnerabilities by injecting code into a vulnerable system to change the course of execution and force an application or a system to process invalid data. Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, manipulation of data, denial-of-service (DoS) conditions, and more. The following are examples of injection-based vulnerabilities that are discussed in the following sections:

- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- HTML injection vulnerabilities
- Command injection vulnerabilities
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) injection vulnerabilities
