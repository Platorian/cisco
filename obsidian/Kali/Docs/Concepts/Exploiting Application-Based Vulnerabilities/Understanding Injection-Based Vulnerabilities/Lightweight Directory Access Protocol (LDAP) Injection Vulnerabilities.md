_LDAP injection vulnerabilities_ are input validation vulnerabilities that an attacker uses to inject and execute queries to LDAP servers. A successful **_LDAP injection_** attack can allow an attacker to obtain valuable information for further attacks on databases and internal applications.

**NOTE** LDAP is an open application protocol that many organizations use to access and maintain directory services in a network. The LDAP protocol is defined in RFC 4511.

Similar to SQL injection and other injection attacks, LDAP injection attacks leverage vulnerabilities that occur when an application inserts unsanitized user input (that is, input that is not validated) directly into an LDAP statement. By sending crafted LDAP packets, attackers can cause the LDAP server to execute a variety of queries and other LDAP statements. LDAP injection vulnerabilities could, for example, allow an attacker to modify the LDAP tree and modify business-critical information.

There are two general types of LDAP injection attacks:

- **Authentication bypass:** The most basic LDAP injection attacks are launched to bypass password and credential checking.
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker could inject crafted LDAP packets to list all resources in an organizationâ€™s directory and perform reconnaissance.
