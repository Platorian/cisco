**Protego Security Solutions**

In this part of the course, we are focusing on misconfiguration of web services that result in security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be caused by something simple, like using well-known defaults in a server configuration, including default passwords. Or misconfigurations may be something a little more complex, like permitting website guests to navigate away from the root of a webserver into other parts of the server or operating system filesystem that could store sensitive information.

At Protego, we use automated vulnerability testing to uncover these issues. Our scanners are very good at finding many security misconfiguration-related vulnerabilities. However, we always need to verify their results and use our knowledge of webserver vulnerabilities, especially in older software versions, to make sure that we haven’t missed something.

Attackers can take advantage of security misconfigurations, including directory traversal vulnerabilities and cookie manipulation.
