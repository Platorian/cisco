Overview

_Clickjacking_ involves using multiple transparent or opaque layers to induce a user into clicking on a web button or link on a page that he or she was not intended to navigate or click. Clickjacking attacks are often referred to as _UI redress attacks_. User keystrokes can also be hijacked using clickjacking techniques. An attacker can launch a clickjacking attack by using a combination of CSS stylesheets, iframes, and text boxes to fool the user into entering information or clicking on links in an invisible frame that can be rendered from a site the attacker created.

According to OWASP, these are the two most common techniques for preventing and mitigating clickjacking:

- Send directive response headers to the proper content security policy (CSP) frame ancestors to instruct the browser not to allow framing from other domains. (This replaces the older X-Frame-Options HTTP headers.)
- Use defensive code in the application to make sure the current frame is the top-level window.

**NOTE** The OWASP Clickjacking Defense Cheat Sheet provides additional details about how to defend against clickjacking attacks.
