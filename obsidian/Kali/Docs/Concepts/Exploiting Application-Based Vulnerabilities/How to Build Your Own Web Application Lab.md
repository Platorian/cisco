There are several intentionally vulnerable applications and virtual machines that you can deploy in a lab (safe) environment to practice your skills. You can also run some of them in Docker containers. Omar Santos has included in his GitHub repository at [_https://h4cker.org/github_](https://h4cker.org/github) numerous resources and links to other tools and intentionally vulnerable systems that you can deploy in your lab.

If you are just getting started, the simplest way to practice your skills in a safe environment is to install Kali Linux or Parrot OS in a VM and set up WebSploit Labs (see websploit.org). Several of the examples covered later in this module and elsewhere in this course use the tools and intentionally vulnerable applications running in WebSploit Labs.
