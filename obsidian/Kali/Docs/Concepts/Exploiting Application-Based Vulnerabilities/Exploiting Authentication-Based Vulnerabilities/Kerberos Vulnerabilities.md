In Module 5, “Exploiting Wired and Wireless Networks,” you learned that one of the most common attacks against Windows systems is the Kerberos golden ticket attack. An attacker can use such an attack to manipulate Kerberos tickets based on available hashes. The attacker only needs to compromise a vulnerable system and obtain the local user credentials and password hashes. If the system is connected to a domain, the attacker can identify a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (KRBTGT) password hash to get the golden ticket.

Another weakness in Kerberos implementations is the use of unconstrained _Kerberos_ _delegation_, a feature that allows an application to reuse the end-user credentials to access resources hosted on a different server. Typically, you should only allow Kerberos delegation on an application server that is ultimately trusted. However, this could have negative security consequences if abused, so Active Directory has Kerberos delegation turned off by default.

**NOTE** Refer to Module 5 for additional information on the Kerberos authentication process and the flaws mentioned here.
