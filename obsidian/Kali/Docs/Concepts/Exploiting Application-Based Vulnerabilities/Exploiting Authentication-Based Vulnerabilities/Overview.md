An attacker can bypass authentication in vulnerable systems by using several methods. The following are the most common ways to take advantage of authentication-based vulnerabilities in an affected system:

- Credential brute forcing
- Session hijacking
- Redirecting
- Exploiting default credentials
- Exploiting weak credentials
- Exploiting Kerberos
