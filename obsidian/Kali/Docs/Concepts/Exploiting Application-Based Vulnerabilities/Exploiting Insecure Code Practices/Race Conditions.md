A _race condition_ occurs when a system or an application attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time. However, due to the nature of such a system or application, the operations must be done in the proper sequence in order to be done correctly. When an attacker exploits such a vulnerability, he or she has a small window of time between when a security control takes effect and when the attack is performed. The attack complexity in race conditions is very high. In other words, race conditions are very difficult to exploit.

**NOTE** Race conditions are also referred to as _time of check to time of use_ (_TOCTOU_) attacks.

An example of a race condition is a security management system pushing a configuration to a security device (such as a firewall or an intrusion prevention system) such that the process rebuilds access control lists and rules from the system. An attacker may have a very small time window in which it could bypass those security controls until they take effect on the managed device.
