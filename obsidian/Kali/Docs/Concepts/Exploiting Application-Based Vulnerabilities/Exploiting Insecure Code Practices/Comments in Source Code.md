Often developers include information in source code that could provide too much information and might be leveraged by an attacker. For example, they might provide details about a system password, API credentials, or other sensitive information that an attacker could find and use.

**NOTE** MITRE created a standard called the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). The CWE lists identifiers that are given to security malpractices or the underlying weaknesses that introduce vulnerabilities. CWE-615, “Information Exposure Through Comments,” covers the flaw described in this section. You can obtain details about CWE-615 at [_https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/615.html_](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/615.html).
