Improper error handling is a type of weakness and security malpractice that can provide information to an attacker to help him or her perform additional attacks on the targeted system. Error messages such as error codes, database dumps, and stack traces can provide valuable information to an attacker, such as information about potential flaws in the applications that could be further exploited.

A best practice is to handle error messages according to a well-thought-out scheme that provides a meaningful error message to the user, diagnostic information to developers and support staff, and no useful information to an attacker.

**TIP** OWASP provides detailed examples of improper error handling at [_https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling_](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling). OWASP also provides a cheat sheet that discusses how to find and prevent error handling vulnerabilities; see [_https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Error_Handling_Cheat_Sheet.html_](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Error_Handling_Cheat_Sheet.html).

**Q.** You are testing the security of a digital store front application by attempting to force the application to crash. Why is this activity included in a penetration test?

**A.** Improper error handling can provide information that helps attackers. Error messages such as error codes, database dumps, and stack traces can provide valuable information to an attacker, such as information about application flaws and the type and version of  server software, the frameworks in use, and database type and version. When penetration testing web applications, it is useful to force errors to get an understanding of the error handling practices that were included in the code.
