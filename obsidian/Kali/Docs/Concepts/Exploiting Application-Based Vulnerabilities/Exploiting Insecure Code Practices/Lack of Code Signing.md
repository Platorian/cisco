_Code signing_ (or _image signing_) involves adding a digital signature to software and applications to verify that the application, operating system, or any software has not been modified since it was signed. Many applications are still not digitally signed today, which means attackers can easily modify and potentially impersonate legitimate applications.

Code signing is similar to the process used for SSL/TLS certificates. A key pair (one public key and one private key) identifies and authenticates the software engineer (developer) and his or her code. This is done by employing trusted certificate authorities (CAs). Developers sign their applications and libraries using their private key. If the software or library is modified after signing, the public key in a system will not be able to verify the authenticity of the developerâ€™s private key signature.

Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that allows you to provide a hash of a file fetch by a web browser (client). SRI verifies file integrity and ensures that files are delivered without any tampering or manipulation by an attacker.
