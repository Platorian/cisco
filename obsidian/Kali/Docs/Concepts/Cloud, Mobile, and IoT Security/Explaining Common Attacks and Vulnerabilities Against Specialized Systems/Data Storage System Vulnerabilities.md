With the incredibly large number of IoT architectures and platforms available today, choosing which direction to focus on is a major challenge. IoT architectures extend from IoT endpoint devices (things) to intermediary “fog” networks and cloud computing. Gateways and edge nodes are devices such as switches, routers, and computing platforms that act as intermediaries (“the fog layer”) between the endpoints and the higher layers of the IoT system. The IoT architectural hierarchy high-level layers are illustrated in Figure 7-4.
