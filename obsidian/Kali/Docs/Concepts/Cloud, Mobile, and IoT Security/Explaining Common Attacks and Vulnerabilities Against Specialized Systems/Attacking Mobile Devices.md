Attackers use various techniques to compromise mobile devices. Select each of these common mobile device attacks for more information.

**Reverse Engineering***

The process of analyzing the compiled mobile app to extract information about its source code could be used to understand the underlying architecture of a mobile application and potentially manipulate the mobile device. Attackers use reverse engineering techniques to compromise the mobile device operating system (for example, Android, Apple iOS) and root or jailbreak mobile devices.

**NOTE** OWASP has different “crack-me” exercises that help you practice reverse engineering of Android and iOS applications. See [_https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Crackmes_](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Crackmes).

**Sandbox Analysis***

iOS and Android apps are isolated from each other via sandbox environments. Sandboxes in mobile devices are a mandatory access control mechanism describing the resources that a mobile app can and can’t access. Android and iOS provide different interprocess communication (IPC) options for mobile applications to communicate with the underlying operating system. An attacker could perform detailed analysis of the sandbox implementation in a mobile device to potentially bypass the access control mechanisms implemented by Google (Android) or Apple (iOS), as well as mobile app developers.

**Spamming***

Unsolicited messages are a problem with email and with text messages and other mobile messaging applications as well. In Module 4, you learned about SMS phishing attacks, which continue to be some of the most common attacks against mobile users. In such an attack, a user may be presented with links that could redirect to malicious sites to steal sensitive information or install malware.

The following are some of the most prevalent vulnerabilities affecting mobile devices. Select each for more information.
