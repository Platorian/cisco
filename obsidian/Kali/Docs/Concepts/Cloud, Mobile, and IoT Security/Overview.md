When we think of network security, we usually think about network infrastructure devices, clients, and servers that are attached to wired or wireless networks. However, any device that is connected to a network could serve as a gateway for attackers to penetrate an organizationâ€™s data network. For example, it has become common to attach a wide range of home devices to the internet, including surveillance cameras, thermostats, televisions, and even refrigerators. More importantly, industrial, and critical infrastructure sensors and controllers are also attached to networks, and often reachable over the internet. Each one of these is a host on a network, and each one of them increases the network attack surface. All of these devices include some sort of embedded server that enables users to connect to them remotely. If you can connect to them over the internet, so can someone else.

Another trend that poses new security challenges is the migration of computing resources, data, and software to the cloud. Clouds are fundamentally different from on-premises computing. The cloud presents a network without a perimeter, there is no border between a traditional internal network and external users as there is when resources are housed on-site. All users are external. This lack of perimeter increases reliance on access control, cloud configuration, and network architecture for security. In addition, cloud applications and data are exposed to the internet via application programming interfaces (API). APIs are like portals into cloud applications and increase the network attack surface dramatically.

Pixel Paradise has adopted an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud delivery model as a way to increase adoption of their games by lowering hardware requirements to play their games and allowing their customers to play anywhere that has sufficient internet access. This exposes Pixel Paradise to risks including potential theft of gaming assets, authorization keys, or denial of access to purchased games. In addition, the Pixel Paradise gaming service includes a digital storefront which includes customer payment information.

We need to test special purpose devices housed at the Pixel Paradise facility, and we also need to test their cloud presence for vulnerabilities.

The adoption of cloud technology and cloud services has revolutionized how organizations develop, host, and deploy applications and store data. In addition, mobile devices and Internet of Things (IoT) devices communicate using a diverse set of protocols and technologies. Mobile and IoT devices also often communicate with applications hosted in the cloud. All these technologies and architectures increase the attack surface and introduce a variety of cybersecurity risks. In this module, you will learn about different attacks against cloud, mobile, and IoT implementations.
