Cloud deployments are susceptible to malware injection attacks. In a **_cloud malware injection attack_**, the attacker creates a malicious application and injects it into a SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS environment. Once the malware injection is completed, the malware is executed as one of the valid instances running in the cloud infrastructure. Subsequently, the attacker can leverage this foothold to launch additional attacks, such as covert channels, backdoors, eavesdropping, data manipulation, and dataÂ theft.
