Much as with scheduled tasks, you can create your own custom daemons (services) and processes on a victim system, as well as additional backdoors. Whenever possible, a backdoor must survive reboots to maintain persistence on the victimâ€™s system. You can ensure this by creating daemons that are automatically started at bootup. These daemons can persist on the system to either further compromise other systems (lateral movement) or exfiltrate data.
