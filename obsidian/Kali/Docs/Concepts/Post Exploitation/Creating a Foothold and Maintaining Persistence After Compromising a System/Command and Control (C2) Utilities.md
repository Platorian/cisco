Attackers often use command and control (often referred to as C2 or CnC) systems to send commands and instructions to compromised systems. The C2 can be the attacker’s system (for example, desktop, laptop) or a dedicated virtual or physical server. A C2 creates a covert channel with the compromised system. A **_covert channel_** is an adversarial technique that allows the attacker to transfer information objects between processes or systems that, according to a security policy, are not supposed to be allowed to communicate.

Attackers often use virtual machines in a cloud service or even use other compromised systems as C2 servers. Even services such as Twitter, Dropbox, and Photobucket have been used for C2 tasks. The C2 communication can be as simple as maintaining a timed beacon, or “heartbeat,” to launch additional attacks or for data exfiltration. Figure 8-3 shows how an attacker uses C2 to send instructions to two compromised systems.

Many different techniques and utilities can be used to create a C2. Select each of the following examples for more information.

**socat**  

A C2 utility that can be used to create multiple reverse shells (see [_http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat_](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat))

**wsc2**  

A Python-based C2 utility that uses WebSockets (see [_https://github.com/Arno0x/WSC2_](https://github.com/Arno0x/WSC2))

**WMImplant***
A PowerShell-based tool that leverages WMI to create a C2 channel (see [_https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/WMImplant_](https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/WMImplant))

**DropboxC2 (DBC2)**  

A C2 utility that uses Dropbox (see [_https://github.com/Arno0x/DBC2_](https://github.com/Arno0x/DBC2))

**TrevorC2**  

A Python-based C2 utility created by Dave Kennedy of TrustedSec (see [_https://github.com/trustedsec/trevorc2_](https://github.com/trustedsec/trevorc2))

**Twittor**  

A C2 utility that uses Twitter direct messages for command and control (see [_https://github.com/PaulSec/twittor_](https://github.com/PaulSec/twittor))

**DNSCat2**  

A DNS-based C2 utility that supports encryption and that has been used by malware, threat actors, and pen testers (see [_https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2_](https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2))

Figure 8-4 shows an example of how TrevorC2 can be used as a command and control framework. This figure shows two terminal windows. The terminal window on the left is the attacking system (C2 server), and the terminal window on the right is the victim (client).
