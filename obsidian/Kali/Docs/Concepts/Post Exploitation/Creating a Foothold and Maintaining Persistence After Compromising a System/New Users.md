After you compromise a system, if you obtain administrator (root) access to the system, you can create additional accounts. These accounts can be used to connect to and interact with the victim system. Just as it is a best practice when configuring user accounts under normal circumstances, you (as an attacker) should create those alternate accounts with complex passwords.
