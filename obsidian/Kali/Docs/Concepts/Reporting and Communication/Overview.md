Why Should I Take This Module?

The testing is complete, and the results recorded. It is time to consult your notes and inform the customer of the results. It is important to understand that all the activities during the test lead to the report. Every result should be recorded along with the way the results were obtained. Note keeping and other types of pentesting documentation management are essential to having the data that we need to report on all the hard work we have done to the customer.

It is easy to get so into what you are doing that you forget to take notes or record results. I have done it myself. Then, when it is time to write the report, it can be very, very difficult to remember everything that we did and everything that we discovered. Not good.

There are new cloud-based tools that treat pentesting as a project. This means that project management tools have been integrated with pentesting tools. These tools provide a collaborative workspace, dashboarding, daily vulnerability tracking, and an integrated workspace in which all notes and testing logs are saved in one place. The software even generates reports from the compiled data.

Our report is our deliverable for what can be an expensive engagement with out client. We take pride in the quality of reports. The best way to get return business and to generate customer referrals is by delivering the most thorough and useful reports that we can.

Once youâ€™ve successfully completed the testing phases of a penetration test, you still have the most important phase to look forward to. Whether you are performing a test for an internal team or you are a contracted penetration tester, providing a quality deliverable is very important. The deliverable for a penetration test is the final report. By providing a quality report, you enable your customer to act on the findings of the report and mitigate the issues found. This module starts by discussing post-engagement activities, such as cleanup of any tools or shells left on systems that were part of the test. This module also covers report writing best practices, including the common report elements as well as findings and recommendations. Finally, this module touches on report handling and communication best practices.
