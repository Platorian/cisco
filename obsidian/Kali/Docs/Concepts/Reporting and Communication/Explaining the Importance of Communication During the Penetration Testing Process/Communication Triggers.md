It is important that you have _situational awareness_ to properly communicate any significant findings to your client. The following are a few examples of communication triggers:

- **Critical findings:** You should document (as early as in the pre-engagement phase) how critical findings should be communicated and when. Your client might require you to report any critical findings at the time of discovery instead of waiting to inform the client in your final report.
- **Status reports:** Your client may ask you to provide periodic status reports about how the testing is progressing.
- **Indicators of prior compromise:** During a penetration test, you may find that a real (malicious) attacker has likely already compromised the system. You should immediately communicate any indicators of prior compromise and not wait until you deliver the final report.

Practice - Communication Triggers

**Q.** You have gained access to a server filesystem duringÂ of the exploitation phase of the Pixel Paradise penetration test. You notice a file that appears out of place. You exfiltrate the file and submit it to a malware sandbox for analysis. The sandbox service recognizes the file as a component of a known backdoor exploit. What should you do with this information?

**A.** This is evidence that a malicious attacker has likely already compromised the system. You should always immediately communicate this to the client to enable immediate mitigation and remediation.
