You should know the proper ways to _deescalate_ any situation you may encounter with a client. You should also try to _deconflict_ any potentially redundant or irrelevant information from your report and communication with your client. Try to identify and avoid _false positives_ in your report.

You should also report any _criminal activity_ that you may have discovered. For example, you may find that one of the employees may be using corporate assets to attack another company, steal information, or perform some other illegal activity.

**TIP** The term _false positive_ is a broad term that describes a situation in which a security device triggers an alarm but there is no malicious activity or actual attack taking place. In other words, false positives are “false alarms”; they are also called “benign triggers”. False positives are problematic because by triggering unjustified alerts, they diminish the value and urgency of real alerts. Having too many false positives to investigate becomes an operational nightmare and is likely to cause you to overlook real security events. There are also _false negatives_, which are malicious activities that are not detected by a network security device. A _true positive_ is a successful identification of a security attack or a malicious event. A _true negative_ occurs when an intrusion detection device identifies an activity as acceptable behavior, and the activity is actually acceptable.
