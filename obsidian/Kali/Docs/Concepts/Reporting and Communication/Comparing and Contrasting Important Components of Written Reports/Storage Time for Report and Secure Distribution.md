The classification of a report’s contents is driven by the organization that the penetration test has been performed on and its policies on classification. In some cases, the contents of a report are considered top secret. However, as a rule of thumb, you should always consider report contents as highly classified and distribute them on a need-to-know basis only. The classification of report contents also determines the method of delivery.

In general, there are two ways to distribute a report: as a hard copy or electronically. Many times, when you perform the readout of the findings from your report, you will be meeting with the stakeholders who requested the penetration test to be performed. This meeting will likely include various people from the organization, including IT, information security, and management. In most cases, they will want to have a hard copy in front of them as you walk through the readout of the findings. This is, of course, possible, but the process should be handled with care.

The following are some examples of how to control the distribution of reports:

- Produce only a **limited number of copies**.
- Define the **distribution list** in the scope of work.
- Label each copy with a **specific ID** or number that is tied to the person it is distributed to.
- Label each copy with the **name of the person** it is distributed to.
- Keep a **log of each hard copy**, including who it was distributed to and the date it was distributed. Table 9-2 shows an example of such a log.
- Ensure that each copy is **physically and formally delivered** to the designated recipient.
- If transferring a report over a network, ensure that the **document is encrypted** and the method of transport is encrypted.
- Ensure that the handling and distribution of an electronic copy of a report are even more restrictive than for a hard copy:  
    - Control distribution on a secure server that is owned by the department that initially requested the penetration test.  
    - Provide only one copy directly to the client or requesting party.  
    - Once the report is delivered to the requesting party, use a documented, secure method of deleting all collected information and any copy of the report from your machine.

Practice - Control and Distribution of Reports

**Q.** You are preparing the Pixel Paradise pentest report for distribution. Your project manager has given you a brief distribution list for the report with the names of the personnel at Pixel Paradise who should receive it. Your manager tells you to make one copy for each person on the list and to carefully destroy any extra copies. Why is the manager so concerned about the number of reports that are produced and the destruction of any extra copies?

**A.** Typically, the penetration test report should be treated as highly classified and distributed on a need-to-know basis. This will help prevent system vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques from being made public or coming into the possession of malicious actors.
