**_Administrative controls_** are policies, rules, or training that are designed and implemented to reduce risk and improve safety. The following are examples of administrative controls that may be recommended in your penetration testing report. Select each administrative control for more information.

This type of control bases access permissions on the specific role or function. Administrators grant access rights and permissions to roles. Each user is then associated with a role. There is no provision for assigning rights to a user or group account. For example, say that you have two users: Hannah and Derek. Derek is associated with the role of Engineer and inherits all the permissions assigned to the Engineer role. Derek cannot be assigned any additional permissions. Hannah is associated with the role “Sales” and inherits all the permissions assigned to the Sales role and cannot access Engineer resources. Users can belong to multiple groups. RBAC enables you to control what users can do at both broad and granular levels.

The software development life cycle (SDLC) provides a structured and standardized process for all phases of any system development effort. The act of incorporating security best practices, policies, and technologies to find and remediate vulnerabilities during the SDLC is referred to as the secure software development life cycle (SSDLC). OWASP provides several best practices and guidance on implementing the SSDLC at [_https://owasp.org/www-project-integration-standards/writeups/owasp_in_sdlc_](https://owasp.org/www-project-integration-standards/writeups/owasp_in_sdlc). In addition, the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) provides an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture. You can find more details about OWASP’s SAMM at [_https://owaspsamm.org_](https://owaspsamm.org).

Different organizations may have different password complexity requirements (for example, minimum length, the use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numeric, and special characters). At the end of the day, the best solution is to use multifactor authentication (as discussed earlier in this module) instead of just simple password authentication.

A cybersecurity policy is a directive that defines how the organization protects its information assets and information systems, ensures compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and maintains an environment that supports the guiding principles. The objective of a cybersecurity policy and corresponding program is to protect the organization, its employees, its customers, and its vendors and partners from harm resulting from intentional or accidental damage, misuse, or disclosure of information, as well as to protect the integrity of the information and ensure the availability of information systems. Successful policies establish what must be done and why it must be done–but not how to do it. A good policy must be endorsed, relevant, realistic, attainable, adaptable, enforceable, and inclusive.
