All employees, contractors, interns, and designated third parties must receive security training appropriate to their position throughout their tenure. The training must cover at least compliance requirements, company policies, and handling of standards. A user should have training and provide written acknowledgment of rights and responsibilities prior to being granted access to information and information systems. Organizations will reap significant benefits from training users throughout their tenure.

Security awareness programs, security training, and security education all serve to reinforce the message that security is important. Security awareness programs are designed to remind users of appropriate behaviors. Security education and training teach specific skills and are the basis for decision-making. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published Special Publication 800-50, “Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program,” which succinctly defines why security education and training are so important.
