Practice - Recommended Controls

**Q.** You are working on the recommendations sections of the Pixel Paradise report and considering the categories of security controls that should be recommended as mitigation. Which categories of controls should you consider? (Choose all that apply.)

**A.** Categories of control that a penetration report should recommend include:

- **technical controls** that use technology to reduce vulnerabilities
- **administrative controls** designed and implemented to reduce risk and improve safety
- **operational controls** that focus on day-to-day operations and strategies
- **physical controls** that use security measures to prevent or deter unauthorized access to sensitive locations or material
