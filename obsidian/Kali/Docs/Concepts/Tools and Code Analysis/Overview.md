I think you'll admit that there is a lot to remember if you are going work effectively as a penetration tester. It looks daunting to someone who is just starting out. However, this is true of any field. It seems like a lot until you get to work and use your knowledge and skills everyday.

Penetration testing companies don't use everything that you have learned about in this course. They each have their own preferred tools, scripts and scripting languages, and document formats. You'll learn about these on the job.

We know that it is overwhelming, so we have included this module for you to refer to when you need to work with code or find just the right tool for the job. It is good to be familiar with everything in this module, but don't worry if you are having problems remembering specifics about every tool mentioned here. Really, just concentrate on which tools are useful for which general tasks. Then, whatever you don't remember you can always look up.
