In Module 8, you learned how to maintain persistence on a compromised system after exploitation. You learned about the Netcat utility, which can be used to create a bind shell on a victim system and to execute the Bash shell. In Module 8, you also learned that you can use remote access protocols to communicate with a compromised system and perform lateral movement. These protocols include the following:

- Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- Apple Remote Desktop
- VNC
- X server forwarding

You can also use PowerShell to get directory listings, copy and move files, get a list of running processes, and perform administrative tasks.

**NOTE** Refer to Module 8 for a list of PowerShell commands you can use to perform post-exploitation activities.

**_PowerSploit_** is a collection of PowerShell modules that can be used for post- exploitation and other phases of an assessment. PowerSploit can be downloaded from [_https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit_](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit).

**_Empire_** is a PowerShell-based post-exploitation framework that is very popular among pen testers. Empire is an open-source framework that includes a PowerShell Windows agent and a Python Linux agent. You can download Empire from [_https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire_](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire).

**NOTE** Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without the need for powershell.exe. It allows you to rapidly deploy post-exploitation modules including keyloggers, reverse shells, Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade detection.
