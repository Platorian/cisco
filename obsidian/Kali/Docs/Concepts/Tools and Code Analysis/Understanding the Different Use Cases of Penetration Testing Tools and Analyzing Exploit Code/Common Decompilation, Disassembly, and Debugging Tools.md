**The GNU Project Debugger**

The GNU Project Debugger (**_GDB_**) is one of the most popular debuggers among software developers and security professionals. With a debugger like GDB, you can troubleshoot and find software bugs, understand what a program was doing at the moment it crashed, make a program stop on specified conditions, and modify elements of a program to experiment or to correct problems.

Traditionally, GDB has mainly been used to debug programs written in C and C++; however, several other programming languages – such as Go, Objective-C, and OpenCL C – are also supported.

**NOTE** For a complete list of supported programming languages, go to [_https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb_](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb).

Example 10-43 shows a simple example of how GDB is used to debug and run a vulnerable application (vuln_program) written in C.

The **run** command is used to run an application inside GDB. The program executes and asks you to enter some text. In this example, a large number of **A** characters are entered, and the program exits. When the **continue** GDB command is executed, the text “Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault” is displayed. This indicates a potential buffer overflow (which is the case in Example 10-43).

**_Example 10-43_** _-_ _Using GDB to Debug a Vulnerable Application_

**NOTE** The source code for the vulnerable application in Example 10-43 is available at [_https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/art-of-hacking/tree/master/buffer_overflow_example_](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/art-of-hacking/tree/master/buffer_overflow_example).

**Windows Debugger**

You can use the Windows Debugger (**_WinDbg_**) to debug kernel and user mode code. You can also use it to analyze crash dumps and to analyze the CPU registers as code executes. You can get debugging tools from Microsoft via the following methods:

- By downloading and installing the Windows Driver Kit (WDK)
- As a standalone tool set
- By downloading the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)
- By downloading Microsoft Visual Studio

**TIP** Refer to the “Getting Started with Windows Debugging Microsoft” whitepaper to learn how to use WinDbg and related tools; see [_https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/getting-started-with-windows-debugging_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/getting-started-with-windows-debugging). You can obtain additional information about Windows debugging and symbols from [_https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/symbols_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/symbols).

**OllyDbg**

**_OllyDbg_** is a debugger created to analyze Windows 32-bit applications. It is included in Kali Linux and other penetration testing distributions; it can also be downloaded from [_https://www.ollydbg.de_](https://www.ollydbg.de).

Figure 10-34 shows a screenshot of OllyDbg in Kali Linux. OllyDbg is used to debug the Windows 32-bit version of the Git installation package.

**edb Debugger**

The edb debugger (often called Evan’s debugger) is a cross-platform debugger that supports AArch32, x86, and x86-64 architectures. It comes by default with Kali Linux, and it can be downloaded from [_https://github.com/eteran/edb-debugger_](https://github.com/eteran/edb-debugger).

Figure 10-35 shows edb being used to analyze the vulnerable program that was used earlier in this module (vuln_program; refer to Example 10-43 above). In this example, the edb debugger steps through the execution of the code, and the user enters a large number of **A** characters, causing a buffer overflow to be exploited. (You can see the different registers, like EIP, filled with **A**.)

**TIP** Your role as a junior penetration tester does not require you to be an expert on registers, instruction pointers, or assembly language. However, if you want to get a better understanding of how registers work, refer to the Art of Hacking GitHub repository, at [_https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/art-of-hacking/blob/master/buffer_overflow_example/registers.md_](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/art-of-hacking/blob/master/buffer_overflow_example/registers.md).

**Immunity Debugger**

**_Immunity Debugger_** is very popular among penetration testers and security researchers. It allows you to write exploits, analyze malware, and reverse engineer binary files. It supports a Python-based API. You can download Immunity Debugger from [_https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/_](https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/).

**Interactive Disassembler (IDA)**

**_Interactive Disassembler (IDA)_** is one of the most popular disassemblers, debuggers, and decompilers on the market. IDA is a commercial product of Hex-Rays, and it can be purchased from [_https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml_](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml).

**NOTE** The following website provides an introduction to use IDA: [_https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/basics-of-ida-pro-2/_](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/basics-of-ida-pro-2/).

Figure 10-36 shows IDA being used to disassemble and analyze the vulnerable program (vuln_program) used previously. You can see the program control flow and how the executable is broken into blocks of functions. Colored arrows show control flow between the function blocks. If an arrow is red, a conditional jump is not taken. If it is green, a jump is taken, and if it is blue, an unconditional jump is taken.

Figure 10-37 shows IDA’s text mode, where you can examine all of the disassembled code of the executable under analysis. The unconditional jump is indicated by solid lines, and conditional jumps are shown as dashed lines.

**Objdump**

Objdump is a Linux program that can be used to display information about one or more object files. You can use Objdump to do quick checks and disassembly of binaries, as demonstrated in Example 10-44.

**TIP** The Art of Hacking GitHub repository includes a list of numerous tools that can be used for reverse engineering: [_https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/art-of-hacking/tree/master/reverse_engineering_](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/art-of-hacking/tree/master/reverse_engineering).

### Practice - Common Decompilation, Disassembly, and Debugging Tools

While investigating the file system of a host on the Pixel Paradise network, you discover a suspected malware binary file. It is important to investigate the purpose and function of the file in case it has caused damage, loss of files, or created additional vulnerabilities. This often requires decompiling the file to investigate the source code. Various tools are available for the analysis of binaries.

Match the decompilation, disassembly, and debugging tools to their descriptions.
