**The GNU Project Debugger**

The GNU Project Debugger (**_GDB_**) is one of the most popular debuggers among software developers and security professionals. With a debugger like GDB, you can troubleshoot and find software bugs, understand what a program was doing at the moment it crashed, make a program stop on specified conditions, and modify elements of a program to experiment or to correct problems.

Traditionally, GDB has mainly been used to debug programs written in C and C++; however, several other programming languages – such as Go, Objective-C, and OpenCL C – are also supported.

**NOTE** For a complete list of supported programming languages, go to [_https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb_](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb).

Example 10-43 shows a simple example of how GDB is used to debug and run a vulnerable application (vuln_program) written in C.

The **run** command is used to run an application inside GDB. The program executes and asks you to enter some text. In this example, a large number of **A** characters are entered, and the program exits. When the **continue** GDB command is executed, the text “Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault” is displayed. This indicates a potential buffer overflow (which is the case in Example 10-43).

**_Example 10-43_** _-_ _Using GDB to Debug a Vulnerable Application_

**NOTE** The source code for the vulnerable application in Example 10-43 is available at [_https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/art-of-hacking/tree/master/buffer_overflow_example_](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/art-of-hacking/tree/master/buffer_overflow_example).
