The following are a few examples of tools and Linux distributions that can be used for forensics:

- **ADIA (Appliance for Digital Investigation and Analysis)**: ADIA is a VMware-based appliance used for digital investigation and acquisition that is built entirely from public domain software. Among the tools contained in ADIA are Autopsy, the Sleuth Kit, the Digital Forensics Framework, log2timeline, Xplico, and Wireshark. Most of the system maintenance uses Webmin. ADIA is designed for small to medium-sized digital investigations and acquisitions. The appliance runs under Linux, Windows, and macOS. Both i386 (32-bit) and x86_64 (64-bit) versions are available. You can download ADIA from [_https://forensics.cert.org/#ADIA_](https://forensics.cert.org/#ADIA).
- **CAINE**: The Computer Aided Investigative Environment (CAINE) contains numerous tools that help investigators with analyses, including forensic evidence collection. You can download CAINE from [_http://www.caine-live.net/index.html_](http://www.caine-live.net/index.html).
- **Skadi**: This all-in-one solution to parsing collected data makes the data easily searchable with built-in common searches and enables searching of single and multiple hosts simultaneously. You can download Skadi from [_https://github.com/orlikoski/Skadi_](https://github.com/orlikoski/Skadi).
- **PALADIN**: PALADIN is a modified Linux distribution for performing various evidence collection tasks in a forensically sound manner. It includes many open source forensics tools. You can download PALADIN from [_https://sumuri.com/software/paladin/_](https://sumuri.com/software/paladin/).
- **Security Onion**: Security Onion, a Linux distro aimed at network security monitoring, features advanced analysis tools, some of which can help in forensic investigations. You can download Security Onion from [_https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion_](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion).
- **SIFT Workstation**: The SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit (SIFT) Workstation demonstrates that advanced incident response capabilities and deep-dive digital forensic techniques to intrusions can be accomplished using cutting-edge open source tools that are freely available and frequently updated. You can download SIFT Workstation from [_https://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/downloads_](https://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/downloads).
