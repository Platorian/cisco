Several Linux distributions include numerous penetration testing tools. The purpose of these Linux distributions is to make it easier for individuals to get started with penetration testing, without having to worry about software dependencies and compatibility issues that could be introduced when installing and deploying such tools. The following are the most popular penetration testing Linux distributions:

- Kali Linux
- Parrot OS
- BlackArch Linux
- BlackArch in Docker

Select each distribution for more information.

**ali Linux**

Kali Linux is one of the most popular penetration testing distributions in the industry. It is based on Debian GNU/Linux, and it evolved from previous penetration testing Linux distributions (WHoppiX, WHAX, and BackTrack). A Kali Linux Live image on a CD/DVD/USB/PXE can give you access to a bare-metal installation. You can download Kali Linux from [_https://www.kali.org_](https://www.kali.org).

Kali Linux comes with hundreds of tools, and the community is constantly creating new ones and adding them to Kali. For the most up-to-date list of penetration testing tools included in Kali Linux, visit [_https://tools.kali.org_](https://tools.kali.org).

Figure 10-1 shows the All Applications menu of Kali Linux, which lists all the major categories of tools included in the distribution.
