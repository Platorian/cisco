Module 5, “Exploiting Wired and Wireless Networks,” discusses how to hack wireless networks. It discusses tools like Aircrack-ng, Kismet, KisMAC, and other tools that can be used to perform assessments of wireless networks. Refer to Module 5 for additional information about those tools.

The following are several wireless hacking tools that can help in testing wireless networks:

- **Wifite2:** This is a Python program to test wireless networks that can be downloaded from [_https://github.com/derv82/wifite2_](https://github.com/derv82/wifite2).
- **Rogue access points:** You can easily create rogue access points by using open-source tools such as hostapd. Omar Santos has a description of how to build your own wireless hacking lab and use hostapd at [_https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/blob/master/wireless_resources/virtual_adapters.md_](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/blob/master/wireless_resources/virtual_adapters.md).
- **EAPHammer:** This tool, which you can use to perform evil twin attacks, can be downloaded from [_https://github.com/s0lst1c3/eaphammer_](https://github.com/s0lst1c3/eaphammer).
- **mdk4:** This tool is used to perform fuzzing, IDS evasions, and other wireless attacks. mdk4 can be downloaded from [_https://github.com/aircrack-ng/mdk4_](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/mdk4).
- **Spooftooph:** This tool is used to spoof and clone Bluetooth devices. It can be downloaded from [_https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/spooftooph_](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/spooftooph).
- **Reaver:** This tool is used to perform brute-force attacks against Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) implementations. Reaver can be downloaded from [_https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/reaver_](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/reaver).
- **Wireless Geographic Logging Engine (WiGLE):** You can learn about this war driving tool at [_https://wigle.net_](https://wigle.net).
- **Fern Wi-Fi Cracker:** This tool is used to perform different attacks against wireless networks, including cracking WEP, WPA, and WPS keys. You can download Fern Wi-Fi Cracker from [_https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/fern-wifi-cracker_](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/fern-wifi-cracker).

Practice - Wireless Tools

**Q.** Match the wireless hacking tool to the description.

**A.** 
![[Pasted image 20240620104649.png]]

**Q.** You are assessing physical security around a pentesting client's facility and notice that employees carry their laptops to the cafe across the street so that they can work while they eat lunch. You are curious about whether you can gain access to their laptops over Bluetooth by posing as a customer of the cafe.

Which tool would you use to spoof and clone Bluetooth devices in order to gain unauthorized wireless access to vulnerable employee laptops?

**A.** Spooftooph permits spoofing and cloning of Bluetooth devices.

**Q.** A high-profile private client has contracted you to do a security audit of their home. The client is concerned that fans or journalists might be able to hack into their personal network. The client told you that the wireless network was setup by his teenaged child, so you are concerned that there may be some vulnerabilities in the network configuration, especially WPS.

What wireless tool is best suited to verifying the security of the WPS implementation in the client's home?

**Q.** Reaver is a tool that is designed to exploit WPS.
