One of the big challenges in our profession is finding the right tool for the job. As you have seen, there are many penetration testing tools available and some of them do many things. It is almost a full-time job keeping track of the tools, their functions, and how to use them. In addition, new tools are becoming available all the time, and old ones are becoming obsolete.

Penetration testers tend to settle on tools that have worked well for them in the past. It is impossible to learn and use all of the tools that are available. It is very useful, however, to understand what the most popular tools do and what tasks they are best suited for. From there, you can try them and learn, and then decide if you want to put them in your penetration testing toolbox.
