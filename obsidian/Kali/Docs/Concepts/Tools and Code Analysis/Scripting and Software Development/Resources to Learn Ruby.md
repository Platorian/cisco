**TIP** The Metasploit exploitation framework mentioned often in this book was created in Ruby, and it comes with source code for exploits, modules, and scripts created in Ruby. It’s a good idea to download Kali Linux or another penetration testing distribution and become familiar with the scripts and exploits that come with Metasploit. This is a good way to familiarize yourself with the structure of Ruby scripts.
