**Protego Security Solutions**

To work successfully as a penetration tester, you need to be familiar with coding, most specifically scripting languages, although knowledge of common compiled languages is also a plus. There are two major reasons for this. First, malware is code. Some of it is compiled code, and much of it is scripts. Although threat actors do as much as they can to obfuscate their code to make it hard to identify and interpret, skilled penetration testers can decipher it. At Protego, it is our duty to inform our clients of any malware that we find and the damage that it may have done. We also need to understand what the code does, because it has possibly created vulnerabilities and persistent access to our clients' systems that we need to know about.

The other reason is that we often need to automate reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning in order to make our tests more efficient and effective. Although automated scanning tools already exist, they don't always give us what we need. You will need to be able to recognize what our existing automation scripts do, how to modify them to fit our current needs, and also how to write your own.

This course and many certification exams require you to have a high-level understanding of Bash, Python, Ruby, PowerShell, and other programming languages. You should become familiar with the basics of scripting languages, such as logic constructs, data structures, libraries, classes, procedures, and functions. The following sections provide a high-level overview of these concepts.

**NOTE** This course does not teach you about any specific programming language. You must either already have these skills or practice and learn them from the resource links provided throughout this module
