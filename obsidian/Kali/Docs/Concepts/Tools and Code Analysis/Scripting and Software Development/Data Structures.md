The following are the most commonly used data structures in programming languages:

- **_JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)_**: JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data that is easy to understand. It is the most common data structure in RESTful APIs and many other implementations. You can interactively learn JSON at [_https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp_](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp).
- **_Arrays_**: An array is a special variable that holds more than one value at a time.
- **_Dictionaries_**: A dictionary is a collection of data values that are ordered using a **_key/value_** **_pair_**. The following is an example of a dictionary in Python:
    
    `dict = {'Name': 'Omar Santos', 'Twitter': '@santosomar'}`
    
- **_Comma-separated values (CSV)_**: A CSV file is a plaintext file that contains data delimited by commas (,) and sometimes tabs or other characters, like semicolons (;).
- **_Lists_**: A list is a data structure in programming languages that contains an ordered structure of elements. The following is an example of a list in Python:
    
    `cves = ['CVE-2022-0945', 'CVE-2023-1234â€™, 'CVE-2022-0987']`
    
- **_Trees_**: A tree is a non-linear data structure represented using nodes in a hierarchical model. The following site includes examples of trees (or binary trees) in Python where you can learn and interact with the source code: [_https://www.educative.io/edpresso/binary-trees-in-python_](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/binary-trees-in-python).
