**Protego Security Solutions Task**

In this lab you will interpret some scripts and commands that are entered in the shell. This will help develop your depth of knowledge regarding penetration testing software and tools. 

It is important that you are able to interpret commands and scripts that you encounter as part of our penetration testing agreements with our customers.

## Conduct research and analyze exploit code samples.

1. Refer to the following command.

```
nmap -sV --script vulners --script-args mincvss=4 10.6.6.23
```

**A.** This command will display known vulnerabilities and their corresponding CVE. The mincvss argument will limit the output to only CVEs with CVSS scores higher than 4.

**Q.** What Kali tool is being launched with the above script?

**A.** The GVM Scanner

**Q.** What scripting language do you think was used?

**A.** First, at the beginning of the script, it is identified as !/bin/bash, meaning that it is a shell script that uses bash syntax. In addition, some of the lines should look familiar to you. These are commands that we have previously used at the command line. Shell scripts use shell commands. and other statements to create executable scripts. The other code can consist of logic constructs such as loops and conditionals, among others.

**Q.** Refer to the line of code shown in the message box:
![Message box with the message <script>alert("You have been hacked!")</script>](https://skillsforall.com/content/eh/1.0/courses/content/m10/en-US/assets/857bad18c0c9ed36275294ac21140bfa3fdb8812.jpg)

What type of exploit is being executed created? Is the exploit stored on the client side or the server side? What language is it?

**A.** This is a Stored XSS exploit. The exploit is stored on the server side. It is JavaScript.

**Q.** In an actual exploit, what could malicious this code do?

**A.** One of the most common is to send users to malicious websites.

**Q.** 4. Refer to the following command.

```
nmap --script smb-enum-users.nse -p139,445 10.6.6.23
```

What information will be displayed from the command?

**A.** Server Message Block (SMB) usernames on the target computer at 10.6.6.23

**Q.** 5. Refer to the following command.

```
1' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT user, password FROM users #
```

**A.** It is an SQL injection exploit. The purpose is to retrieve usernames and passwords from a database table called “users”.

**Q.** 6. Refer to the following commands.

```
smbclient //172.17.0.2/tmp

smb: >put malicious_file.txt malicious_file.txt
```

**A.** The transfer of files between systems using the smbclient utility

### Reflection

_Why is it important that an Ethical Hacker be familiar with exploit code in various scripting languages?

**Ethical Hackers may need to create or use exploit scripts in order to assess the security of various systems, including web applications.**

What will the following commands do? (Choose all that apply.)

```
smbclient //192.168.0.27/tmp
smb: > **put test.txt holiday_party.txt**
```

The command will open an smbclient prompt on the source machine and copy the file test.txt to the tmp directory of the host at 192.168.0.27 with the filename of holiday_party.txt
