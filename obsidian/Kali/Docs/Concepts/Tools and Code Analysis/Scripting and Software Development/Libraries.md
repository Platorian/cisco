A **_library_** is a collection of resources that can be reused by programs. Libraries can include the following:

- Prewritten code
- Configuration information
- Subroutines
- Documentation and help information
- Message templates
- Classes

**TIP** Each programming language supports a set of standard and third-party libraries. For example, the following website describes the Python standard library: [_https://docs.python.org/3/library_](https://docs.python.org/3/library).
