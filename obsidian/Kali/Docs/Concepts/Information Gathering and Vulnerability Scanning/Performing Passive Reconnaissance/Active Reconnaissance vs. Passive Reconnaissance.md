**_Active reconnaissance_** is a method of information gathering in which the tools used actually send out probes to the target network or systems in order to elicit responses that are then used to determine the posture of the network or system. These probes can use various protocols and multiple levels of aggressiveness, typically based on what is being scanned and when. For example, you might be scanning a device such as a printer that does not have a very robust TCP/IP stack or network hardware. By sending active probes, you might crash such a device. Most modern devices do not have this problem; however, it is possible, so when doing active scanning, you should be conscious of this and adjust your scanner settings accordingly.

**_Passive reconnaissance_** is a method of information gathering in which the tools do not interact directly with the target device or network. There are multiple methods of passive reconnaissance. Some involve using third-party databases to gather information. Others also use tools in such a way that they will not be detected by the target. These tools, in particular, work by simply listening to the traffic on the network and using intelligence to deduce information about the device communication on the network. This approach is much less invasive on a network, and it is highly unlikely for this type of reconnaissance to crash a system such as a printer. Because it does not produce any traffic, it is also unlikely to be detected and does not raise any flags on the network that it is surveying. Another scenario in which a passive scanner would come in handy would be for a penetration tester who needs to perform analysis on a production network that cannot be disrupted. The passive reconnaissance technique that you use depends on the type of information that you wish to obtain. One of the most important aspects of learning about penetration testing is developing a good methodology that will help you select the appropriate tools and technologies to use during the engagement.
