**Protego Security Solutions Task**

Personnel are considered to be the weakest link in network security. For example, people are willing to expose a surprising amount of information about themselves on social media. This information can be used by attackers in various ways. It can help them to find information about a user including possible usernames, likely passwords, and information that can be used to launch successful social engineering attacks. Information gathered from social media can be used in successful pretexts that can lead people to do dangerous things.

For this reason it is important that we know as much as we can about key personnel at Pixel Paradise. Identifying potential security risks that are caused by information in social media profiles and posts is part of our pentesting agreement with our client. Get familiar with some of the ways that social media posts can be used by threat actors by doing this lab.

# Instructions

## Part 1: Gather Information Through Social Media.

For this lab, you will play the role of a cybercriminal and investigate your own social media to see how much PII you can obtain. Alternatively, you can get permission from someone you know well, such as a friend or relative, and investigate their social media. At the end of the exercise, you can share with them what you discover.

### Step 1: Conduct the investigation.

Conduct a search for your name and usernames, using different search engines. Open an incognito or private window for this lab. This will prevent any of your saved login information from populating and you should not see any cached content as you search. Use variations of your name as well, with and without a middle name or initial, married, and maiden names, etc.

This will allow you to see what is indexed.

### Step 2: Perform an audit as a stranger.

1. Create a “bogus” social media account to view your own profiles as a stranger would.
2. Conduct an audit of all the social media sites and accounts you have used.

Look for identifiable information and behavioral patterns that could be helpful to an attacker. This includes things like your place of employment, where you live, online shopping preferences, your daily schedule, vacation plans, political beliefs, interests, hobbies, education, cultural beliefs, family members, pets, etc.

Items to investigate include:

1. All your social media profiles - name, birthdate, contact information, etc.
2. Your status updates - life events, work relationships and status, political and religious beliefs.
3. Location data - hometown information and geo check-ins.
4. Shared content - pictures and comments you have posted and those where you are mentioned or tagged.
5. Posts from friends and family.
6. Any online discussions you have joined or participated in.
