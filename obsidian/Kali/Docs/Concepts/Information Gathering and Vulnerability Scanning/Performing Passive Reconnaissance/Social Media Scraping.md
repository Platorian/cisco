Attackers can easily gather valuable information about victims by scraping social media sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram. People post too many things online. They publicly talk about their hobbies, the restaurants they visit, what they do for work, work promotions, where they travel for business and pleasure, and much more.

Often attackers use other information such as key contacts (company stakeholders) and their job responsibilities. Attackers can use all that information to perform different types of social engineering attacks (including spear phishing and whaling). You will learn details about social engineering attacks in Module 4, “Social Engineering Attacks.”

Attackers often leverage job listings in websites like Indeed, LinkedIn, CareerBuilder, and individual company websites to obtain information about the technologies these companies use (for example, the technology stack of an organization). Let’s say a company is looking for a Cisco firewall administrator, an Ansible expert, and a Mongo database architect in Raleigh, North Carolina. The attacker didn’t have to launch any tools to learn that the company is using Cisco firewalls, MongoDB, and Ansible for automation in its Raleigh office.

Similarly, attackers have also created job posts to attract people to apply for those positions. Then they interview their victims to try to get them to talk about what they do at work and the technologies used by their employer. Think about it: When people are trying to get a job, they want to “show off” and often reveal too much information about the technologies, architectures, and applications that they use in their current roles.
