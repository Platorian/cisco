Reconnaissance is important for understanding our client's assets and attack surface. However, reconnaissance does not necessarily identify actual vulnerabilities. We may know the platforms and services that are reachable by threat actors, but are there known vulnerabilities in those platforms and services?

Vulnerability scans offer an automated way of linking scan information to details of vulnerabilities that exist for the scan results. With this information, it is possible to craft exploits that can lead to serious consequences such as data breaches and service disruptions. With a collection of these vulnerabilities, we can move forward to actual penetration of the network and assessment of risks that such exploits pose to Pixel Paradise.

As you might already know, running a vulnerability scan is really the easy part of the information gathering and vulnerability identification process. The majority of the work goes into analyzing the results you obtain from the tools you use for vulnerability scanning. These tools are not foolproof; they can provide false positives, and the false positives need to be sorted out to determine what the actual vulnerabilities are.

For example, say that you are part of an information security team doing internal vulnerability scans on your network. You run your vulnerability scanning tool of choice and then export a report of the findings from the scan. Next, you turn over the report to the endpoint team to address all the issues noted in the report. The endpoint team begins to address the issues one by one. Its process would likely include an investigation of an endpoint to determine how to best mitigate a finding about it. If the report that you provide includes false positives, the endpoint team will end up wasting a lot of time chasing down issues that don’t actually exist. This can obviously cause some problems between the security team and the endpoint team. This scenario can also be applied to other situations.

When you are providing a report as a deliverable of a paid penetration testing assignment, it is especially important that the report be accurate. Say that you have been hired to identify vulnerabilities on a customer’s network. Your deliverable is to provide a full report of security issues that need to be addressed to protect the customer’s environment. Turning over a report that includes false positives will waste your customer’s time and will likely result in your losing the customer’s repeat business. As you can see from this discussion, reducing the false positives in vulnerability scans is very important.

So how do you go about eliminating false positives? The process involves a detailed and thorough look into the results that your vulnerability scanning tool has provided. Suppose that the results of a scan reveal that there is a possible remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache web server that is running on the target server. This type of finding is likely to be flagged as a high-severity vulnerability, and it should therefore be prioritized. To determine if this is a valid finding, you would first want to take a look at what the vulnerability scanner did to come to this conclusion. Did it pull the version information directly from the system by using a credentialed scan, or was it determined by remotely connecting to the port? As you know, the results of a credentialed scan are more likely than remote analysis to be valid.

Because the method of harvesting version information varies based on the scanner and the service, you should be able to take a look at the details of the findings in a report to determine how the information was gathered. From there, if possible, you would want to connect directly to the target that is reporting a particular vulnerability and try to manually determine the version information of that service. Once you validate that the version reported by the scanner does actually match what is on the system, you also need to dig deeper into the details of the vulnerability. Each vulnerability will typically map to one or many items in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list. You need to take a look at the particulars of those CVE items to understand the criteria because a vulnerability may be flagged based on only one piece of information (such as the version number of the Apache server pulled from the banner). When you dig into the CVE details, you might find that for the vulnerability to be exploitable, this version of Apache must be running on a specific version or distribution of Linux. Most vulnerability scanners are able to correlate multiple pieces of information to make the determination. However, some Linux operating systems, such as Red Hat, report an older version of a service that has actually been patched for the specific vulnerability. This is called _backporting_. So, as you can see, there is more to it than just running a scan. Of course, the number-one method of validating a finding from a vulnerability scan is to exploit the vulnerability, as discussed in many of the upcoming modules.
