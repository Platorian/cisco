As a penetration tester, your goal is to identify weaknesses that can be exploited. As previously discussed, vulnerability scanning is a method of identifying potential exploits. After you identify a vulnerability, you need to verify it. There are many ways to determine if a vulnerability scannerâ€™s findings are valid. The ultimate validation is exploitation.

To determine if a vulnerability is exploitable, you need to first identify an exploit for a vulnerability. Suppose your vulnerability scanner reports that there is an outdated version of Apache Struts that is vulnerable to a remotely exploitable unauthenticated defect. One of the first things you would want to do is to determine if there is a readily available exploit. Many times, this can be found with an exploitation framework such as Metasploit. As a general rule, if a vulnerability has a matching module in Metasploit, it should almost always be considered high severity. That being said, there are also other methods for finding exploits, and you can always write your own exploits.

How do you prioritize your findings for the next phase of your penetration test? To determine the priority, you need to answer a few questions:

- What is the severity of the vulnerability?
- How many systems does the vulnerability apply to?
- How was the vulnerability detected?
- Was the vulnerability found with an automated scanner or manually?
- What is the value of the device on which the vulnerability was found?
- Is this device critical to your business or infrastructure?
- What is the attack vector, and does it apply to your environment?
- Is there a possible workaround or mitigation available?

Answering these questions can help you determine the priority you should assign to the vulnerabilities found. Standard protocol would have you start with the highest-severity vulnerabilities that have the greatest likelihood of being exploited. If these vulnerabilities are actually valid, they might already be compromised. (If at any time during a penetration test, you find that a system is being actively exploited, you should report it right away to the system owner.) Next, you should address any vulnerabilities that are on critical systems, regardless of the severity level. It is possible that there might be an exploit chain available to an attacker that would allow a lower-severity vulnerability to become critical. You need to protect critical systems first. Next, you might want to prioritize based on how many systems are affected by the finding. If a large number of systems are affected, then this would raise the priority because many exploits on this vulnerability would have a higher impact on your environment. These are suggested guidelines, but when it comes to prioritization of vulnerability management and mitigation, it really depends on the specific environment.
