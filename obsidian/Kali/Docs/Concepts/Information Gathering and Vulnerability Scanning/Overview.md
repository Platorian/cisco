**Protego Security Solutions**

Protego is starting the pentests for the Pixel Paradise customer. In this information gathering phase, you will learn about and practice your skills by doing passive and active reconnaissance as a basis for exploitation of discovered vulnerabilities.

---

The first step a threat actor takes when planning an attack is to gather information about the target. This act of information gathering is known as _reconnaissance_. Attackers use scanning and enumeration tools along with public information available on the Internet to build a dossier about a target. As you can imagine, as a penetration tester, you must also replicate these methods to determine the exposure of the networks and systems you are trying to defend. This module begins with a discussion of what reconnaissance is in general and the difference between passive and active methods. You will briefly learn about some of the common tools and techniques used. From there, the module digs deeper into the process of vulnerability scanning and how scanning tools work, including how to analyze vulnerability scanner results to provide useful deliverables and explore the process of leveraging the gathered information in the exploitation phase. The module concludes with coverage of some of the common challenges to consider when performing vulnerability scans.
