Now letâ€™s take a look at how typical vulnerability scanners work (see Figure 3-15). They are all different in some ways, but most of them follow a similar process:

**Step 1.** In the discovery phase, the scanner uses a tool such as Nmap to perform host and port enumeration. Using the results of the host and port enumeration, the scanner begins to probe open ports for more information.

**Step 2.** When the scanner has enough information about the open port to determine what software and version are running on that port, it records that information in a database for further analysis. The scanner can use various methods to make this determination, including using banner information.

**Step 3.** The scanner tries to determine if the software that is listening on the target system is susceptible to any known vulnerabilities. It does this by correlating a database of known vulnerabilities against the information recorded in the database about the target services.

**Step 4.** The scanner produces a report on what it suspects could be vulnerable. Keep in mind that these results are often false positives and need to be validated. At the very least, this type of tool gives you an idea of where to look for vulnerabilities that might be exploitable.
