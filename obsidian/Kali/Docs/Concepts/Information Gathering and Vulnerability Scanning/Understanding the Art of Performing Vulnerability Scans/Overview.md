Now that we have discovered network assets, we need to uncover any vulnerabilities that might exist in them. To do this, we will use the vulnerability scanning features of Nmap and other vulnerability assessment tools. We are testing not for vulnerabilities in web applications, that is very important and will be covered later. Instead, we are looking for host-based vulnerabilities related to the operating systems and services that are running on the devices.

Once you have identified the target hosts that are available and the services that are listening on those hosts, you can begin to probe those services to determine if there are any weaknesses; this is what vulnerability scanners do. Vulnerability scanners use a number of different methods to determine whether a service is vulnerable. The primary method is to identify the version of the software that is running on the open service and try to match it with an already known vulnerability. For instance, if a vulnerability scanner determines that a Linux server is running an outdated version of the Apache web server that is vulnerable to remote exploitation, it reports that vulnerability as a finding.

Of course, the main concern with automated vulnerability scanners is false positives; the output from a vulnerability scan may be useless if no validation is done on the findings. Turning over a report full of false positives to a developer or an administrator who is then responsible for fixing the issues can really cause conflicts. You donâ€™t want someone chasing down findings in your report just to find out that they are false positives.
