An attacker can cause legitimate wireless clients to deauthenticate from legitimate wireless APs or wireless routers to either perform a DoS condition or to make those clients connect to an evil twin. This type of attack is also known as a **_disassociation attack_** because the attacker disassociates (tries to disconnect) the user from the authenticating wireless AP and then carries out another attack to obtain the user’s valid credentials.

A service set identifier (SSID) is the name or identifier associated with an 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN). SSID names are included in plaintext in many wireless packets and beacons. A wireless client needs to know the SSID in order to associate with a wireless AP. It is possible to configure wireless passive tools like Kismet or KisMAC to listen to and capture SSIDs and any other wireless network traffic. In addition, tools such as _Airmon-ng_ (which is part of the _Aircrack-ng suite_) can perform this reconnaissance. The Aircrack-ng suite of tools can be downloaded from [_https://www.aircrack-ng.org_](https://www.aircrack-ng.org). Example shows the Airmon-ng tool. The system in this example has five different wireless network adapters, and the adapter wlan1 is used for monitoring.

The **airmon-ng** command output shows that the wlan1 interface is present and used to monitor the network. The command **ip -s -h -c link show wlan1** can be used to verify the state and configuration of the wireless interface. When you put a wireless network interface in monitoring mode, Airmon-ng automatically checks for any interfering processes. To stop any interfering process, you can use the **airmon-ng check kill** command.

The _Airodump-ng_ tool (which is also part of the Aircrack-ng suite) can be used to sniff and analyze wireless network traffic.

You can use the Airodump-ng tool to sniff wireless networks and obtain their SSIDs, along with the channels they are operating.

Many corporations and individuals configure their wireless APs to not advertise (broadcast) their SSIDs and to not respond to broadcast probe requests. However, if you sniff on a wireless network long enough, you will eventually catch a client trying to associate with the AP and can then get the SSID.

You can see the basic service set identifier (BSSID) and the extended basic service set identifier (ESSID) for every available wireless network. Basically, the ESSID identifies the same network as the SSID. You can also see the ENC encryption protocol. The encryption protocols can be Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) version 1, WPA version 2 (WPA2), WPA version 3 (WPA3), Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), or open (OPN). (You will learn the differences between these protocols later in this module.)

Let’s take a look at how to perform a de-authentication attack.

You can see two terminal windows. The top terminal window displays the output of the Airodump-ng utility on a specific channel (**11**) and one ESSID (**corp-net**). In that same terminal window, you can see a wireless client (**station**) in the bottom, along with the BSSID to which it is connected (**08:02:8E:D3:88:82** in this example).

The bottom terminal window in Figure shows the launch of a de-authentication attack using the Aireplay-ng utility. The victim station has the MAC address **DC:A4:CA:67:3B:01**, and it is currently associated with the network on channel 11 with the BSSID **08:02:8E:D3:88:82**. After the **aireplay-ng** command is used, the deauthentication (**DeAuth**) message is sent to the BSSID **08:02:8E:D3:88:82**. The attack can be accelerated by sending the deauthentication packets to the client using the **-c** option.

The 802.11w standard defines the Management Frame Protection (MFP) feature. MFP protects wireless devices against spoofed management frames from other wireless devices that might otherwise deauthenticate a valid user session. In other words, MFP helps defend against deauthentication attacks. MFP is negotiated between the wireless client (supplicant) and the wireless infrastructure device (AP, wireless router, and so on).
