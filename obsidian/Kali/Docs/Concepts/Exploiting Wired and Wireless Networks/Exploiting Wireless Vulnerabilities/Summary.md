This topic covers a variety of wireless vulnerabilities and exploits.

**Rogue Access Points**, **Evil Twin**, and **Disassociation** attacks involve an attacker installing a rogue AP or impersonating a legitimate one to gain unauthorized access to the network. To defend against such attacks, use packet filtering, cryptographic protocols, and spoofing detection features.

**Preferred Network List (PNL)** attacks involve attackers listening to client requests and impersonating the wireless networks to intercept communication. **Wireless signal jamming and interference** involve attackers causing disruption or denial of service (DoS) on wireless networks. **War driving** and war flying involve attackers searching for wireless networks while driving or flying by in order to exploit them.

**Initialization Vector (IV)** attacks involve exploiting vulnerabilities in older protocols like WEP. Attacks against WEP are possible due to weak encryption methods, while attacks against WPA and WPA2 involve capturing the four-way handshake and brute-forcing the PSK. WPA3 addresses many of these vulnerabilities, but is not completely immune to attacks such as side-channel attacks, downgrade attacks, and DoS conditions. Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) PIN attacks involve brute-forcing the PIN used to provision the wireless device. Tools like Reaver can be used to execute WPS attacks.

**KARMA** (karma attacks radio machines automatically) is an on-path attack where a rogue access point (AP) intercepts wireless traffic from radio machines like mobile devices and laptops.

**Fragmentation attacks** target WEP-configured devices to acquire 1500 bytes of pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA) elements, allowing attackers to generate packets for wireless injection attacks.

**Credential harvesting** involves obtaining or compromising user credentials through methods like phishing attacks, or by impersonating a wireless AP or a captive portal.

**Bluejacking** sends unsolicited messages to victims via Bluetooth, while **Bluesnarfing** accesses unauthorized information from a Bluetooth-enabled device.

**Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** are typically targeted at Internet of Things (IoT) devices that use BLE for communication. These devices are susceptible to on-path attacks, with attackers modifying BLE messages or launching DoS attacks.

**Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)** technology is used to identify and track tags holding electronically stored information. Common attacks include silently stealing RFID information, cloning RFID tags, implanting skimmers, and performing NFC amplification attacks.

**Password spraying** is a type of credential attack where an attacker brute-forces logins using a list of usernames with default passwords.

**Exploit chaining** are sophisticated attacks that leverage multiple vulnerabilities, where an attacker chains exploits against known or zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise systems and steal, modify, or corrupt data.
