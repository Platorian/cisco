Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a technology that uses electromagnetic fields to identify and track tags that hold electronically stored information. There are active and passive RFID tags. Passive tags use energy from RFID readers (via radio waves), and active tags have local power sources and can operate from longerÂ distances. Many organizations use RFID tags to track inventory or in badges used to enter buildings or rooms. RFID tags can even be implanted into animals or people to read specific information that can be stored in the tags.

Low-frequency (LF) RFID tags and devices operate at frequencies between 120kHz and 140kHz, and they exchange information at distances shorter than 3 feet. High-frequency (HF) RFID tags and devices operate at the 13.56MHz frequency and exchange information at distances between 3 and 10 feet. Ultra-high-frequency (UHF) RFID tags and devices operate at frequencies between 860MHz and 960MHz (regional) and exchange information at distances of up to 30 feet.

A few attacks are commonly launched against RFID devices:

- Attackers can silently steal RFID information (such as a badge or a tag) with an RFID reader such as the Proxmark3 ([_https://proxmark.com_](https://proxmark.com)) by just walking near an individual or a tag.
- Attackers can create and clone an RFID tag (in a process called **_RFID cloning_**). They can then use the cloned RFID tags to enter a building or a specific room.
- Attackers can implant skimmers behind RFID card readers in a building or a room.
- Attackers can use amplified antennas to perform NFC amplification attacks. Attackers can also use amplified antennas to exfiltrate small amounts of data, such as passwords and encryption keys, over relatively long distances.
