KARMA (which stands for _karma attacks radio machines automatically_) is an on-path attack that involves creating a rogue AP and allowing an attacker to intercept wireless traffic. A radio machine could be a mobile device, a laptop, or any Wi-Fi-enabled device.

In a KARMA attack scenario, the attacker listens for the probe requests from wireless devices and intercepts them to generate the same SSID for which the device is sending probes. This can be used to attack the PNL, as discussed earlier in this module.
