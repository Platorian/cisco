**_Password spraying_** is a type of credential attack in which an attacker brute-forces logins (that is, attempts to authenticate numerous times) based on a list of usernames with default passwords of common systems or applications. For example, an attacker could try to log in with the word password1 using numerous usernames in a wordlist.

A similar attack is credential stuffing. In this type of attack, the attacker performs automated injection of usernames and passwords that have been exposed in previous breaches.

***Exploit Chaining***
Most sophisticated attacks leverage multiple vulnerabilities to compromise systems. An attacker may “chain” (that is, use multiple) exploits against known or zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise systems, steal, modify, or corrupt data.
