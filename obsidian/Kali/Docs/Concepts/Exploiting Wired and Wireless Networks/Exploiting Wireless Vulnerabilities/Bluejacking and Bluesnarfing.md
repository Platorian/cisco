**_Bluejacking_** is an attack that can be performed using Bluetooth with vulnerable devices in range. An attacker sends unsolicited messages to a victim over Bluetooth, including a contact card (vCard) that typically contains a message in the name field. This is done using the Object Exchange (OBEX) protocol. A vCard can contain name, address, telephone numbers, email addresses, and related web URLs. This type of attack has been mostly performed as a form of spam over Bluetooth connections.

**NOTE** You can find an excellent paper describing Bluejacking at [_http://acadpubl.eu/jsi/2017-116-8/articles/9/72.pdf_](http://acadpubl.eu/jsi/2017-116-8/articles/9/72.pdf).

Another Bluetooth-based attack is Bluesnarfing. **_Bluesnarfing_** attacks are performed to obtain unauthorized access to information from a Bluetooth-enabled device. An attacker can launch Bluesnarfing attacks to access calendars, contact lists, emails and text messages, pictures, or videos from the victim.

Bluesnarfing is considered riskier than Bluejacking because whereas Bluejacking attacks only transmit data to the victim device, Bluesnarfing attacks actually steal information from the victim device.

Bluesnarfing attacks can also be used to obtain the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number for a device. Attackers can then divert incoming calls and messages to another device without the user’s knowledge.

Example 5-22 shows how to obtain the name (**omar_phone**) of a Bluetooth-enabled device with address **DE:AD:BE:EF:12:23** by using the Bluesnarfer tool.
