Operating systems and wireless supplicants (clients), in many cases, maintain a list of trusted or preferred wireless networks. This is also referred to as the _preferred network list (PNL)_. A PNL includes the wireless network SSID, plaintext passwords, or WEP or WPA passwords. Clients use these preferred networks to automatically associate to wireless networks when they are not connected to an AP or a wireless router.

It is possible for attackers to listen to these client requests and impersonate the wireless networks in order to make the clients connect to the attackersâ€™ wireless devices and eavesdrop on their conversation or manipulate their communication.
