_War driving_ is a method attackers use to find wireless access points wherever they might be. By just driving (or walking) around, an attacker can obtain a significant amount of information over a very short period of time. Another similar attack is _war flying_, which involves using a portable computer or other mobile device to search for wireless networks from an aircraft, such as a drone or another unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

**TIP** A popular site among war drivers is WiGLE ([_https://wigle.net_](https://wigle.net)). The site allows users to detect Wi-Fi networks and upload information about the networks by using a mobile app.
