In an **_evil twin_** attack, the attacker creates a rogue access point and configures it exactly the same as the existing corporate network

Typically, the attacker uses DNS spoofing to redirect the victim to a cloned captive portal or a website. When users are logged on to the evil twin, a hacker can easily inject a spoofed DNS record into the DNS cache, changing the DNS record for all users on the fake network. Any user who logs in to the evil twin will be redirected by the spoofed DNS record injected into the cache. 

An attacker who performs a DNS cache poisoning attack wants to get the DNS cache to accept a spoofed record. Some ways to defend against DNS spoofing are using packet filtering, cryptographic protocols, and spoofing detection features provided by modern wireless implementations.

###  **TIP**
_Captive portals_ are web portals that are typically used in wireless networks in public places such as airports and coffee shops. They are typically used to authenticate users or to simply display terms and conditions that apply to users when they are using the wireless network. The user can simply click Accept to agree to the terms and conditions. In some cases, the user is asked to view an advertisement, provide an email address, or perform some other required action. Attackers can impersonate captive portals to perform social engineering attacks or steal sensitive information from users.
