Numerous IoT devices use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication. BLE communications can be susceptible to on-path attacks, and an attacker could modify the BLE messages between systems that would think that they are communicating with legitimate systems. DoS attacks can also be problematic for BLE implementations. Several research efforts have demonstrated different BLE attacks. For instance, Ohio State University researchers have discovered different fingerprinting attacks that can allow an attacker to reveal design flaws and misconfigurations of BLE devices.
