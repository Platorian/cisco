Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks have been around for quite some time, but there has been heightened awareness of them over the past few years. DoS attacks can generally be divided into three categories, described in the following sections:

- Direct
- Botnet
- Reflected
- Amplification

**Direct DoS Attacks  

A direct DoS attack occurs when the source of the attack generates the packets, regardless of protocol, application, and so on, that are sent directly to the victim of the attack.

The attacker launches a direct DoS attack to a web server (the victim) by sending numerous TCP SYN packets. This type of attack is aimed at flooding the victim with an overwhelming number of packets in order to oversaturate its connection bandwidth or deplete the target’s system resources. This type of attack is also known as a _SYN flood attack_.

**Botnet**

Many attackers use botnets to launch DDoS attacks. A _botnet _is a collection of compromised machines that the attacker can manipulate from a command and control (CnC, or C2) system to participate in a DDoS attack, send spam emails, and perform other illicit activities.

**Reflected DoS and DDoS Attacks  

With reflected DoS and DDoS attacks, attackers send to sources spoofed packets that appear to be from the victim, and then the sources become unwitting participants in the reflected attack by sending the response traffic back to the intended victim. UDP is often used as the transport mechanism in such attacks because it is more easily spoofed due to the lack of a three-way handshake. For example, if the attacker decides he wants to attack a victim, he can send packets (for example, Network Time Protocol [NTP] requests) to a source that thinks these packets are legitimate. The source then responds to the NTP requests by sending the responses to the victim, who was not expecting these NTP packets from the source.

**Amplification DDoS Attacks  

An amplification attack is a form of reflected DoS attack in which the response traffic (sent by the unwitting participant) is made up of packets that are much larger than those that were initially sent by the attacker (spoofing the victim). An example of this type of attack is an attacker sending DNS queries to a DNS server configured as an open resolver. Then the DNS server (open resolver) replies with responses much larger in packet size than the initial query packets. The end result is that the victim’s machine gets flooded by large packets for which it never actually issued queries.

### Extra

**Q:** You have been asked to test the resilience of the Pixel Paradise commerce website by carrying on a direct DDoS attack. What will you do to execute this test?

**A:** A botnet is a group of internet-connected devices that are running bot software. Botnets can perform direct Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in which multiple systems target a single system with DoS attacks. The targeted device is then bombarded with packets from multiple locations.

In a simple direct DoS attack, a single host, such as a hacker tools VM, is used to flood a victim with packets. In redirection DDoS attacks, the attacker spoofs the source address of packets that require responses. The packets with spoofed source address are sent to a number of hosts. Those hosts then flood the victim with responses. In another type of redirection attack, responses are amplified by causing open-resolver DNS servers to respond with large amounts of data.
