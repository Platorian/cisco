**Protego Security Solutions Task**

A lot of work has been done to create a universal way of sharing information about known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanning tools map scan results to relevant vulnerabilities in the form of CVE numbers, so it is important to know what the CVE numbers represent and how to find out details regarding their severity and affected systems and software versions.

Please review the information in this lab to ensure that you are clear on the differences between sources of vulnerability information and how to use them.

In this lab, you will use multiple helpful sources to further investigate vulnerabilities.

- Part 1: Investigate Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)
- Part 2: Explore Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs)
- Part 3: Investigate National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Vulnerability Resources
- Part 4: Research Vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

# Instructions

## Part 1: Investigate Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)

### Step 1: Explore CVE.

1. Launch the CVE website and navigate to [www.cve.org](http://www.cve.org).
2. Read the overview of the CVE program.
    1. Select **About > Overview** in the menu.
    2. View the CVE Program Overview video.
    3. Review the available Podcasts for more detailed information about the CVE program.

### Step 2: Use the CVE program to gather information about vulnerabilities.

In an earlier lab, you scanned a target system for vulnerabilities. The list of vulnerabilities found returned the following six CVEs:

- CVE-2021-41617
- CVE-2020-14145
- CVE-2019-16905
- CVE-2019-6111
- CVE-2019-6110
- CVE-2019-6109

1. Enter **CVE-2021-41617** info the search window and click **Find**.

At the bottom of the page click **CVE-2021-41617** to view additional information about the CVE from the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

- On the CVE site ([www.cve.org](http://www.cve.org)), enter **CVE-2019-6111** into the search box and click **Find**.
- Scroll down to the bottom of the CVE page and click **CVE-2019-6111** to view additional information on the NVD.
- On the NVD page for **CVE-2019-6111**, scroll down to the **Weakness Enumeration** section.

## Part 2: Explore Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

### Step 1: Explore CWE.

1. Launch the CWE website and navigate to [https://cwe.mitre.org](https://cwe.mitre.org).
2. Explore the CVE program.by selecting **About** > **Overview** in the menu.

## Part 3: Investigate National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Vulnerability Resources

### Step 1: Explore NIST.

1. Launch the NIST website by navigating to [https://www.nist.gov](https://www.nist.gov).
2. Select **About NIST** > **About Us** in the menu and review the overview of NIST.

## Part 4: Research Vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

### Step 1: Explore CVSS.

1. Launch the CVSS website and navigate to [https://first.org/cvss](https://first.org/cvss)
2. Review the information on the CVSS.
3. Investigate CVSS ratings by clicking **Specification Document** in the left menu.

1. Click **Examples** in the left menu.
2. Click the link for **CVSS version 3.1** examples.
3. Scroll down the page and review the example CVEs and how their CVSS v3.1 Base Scores were calculated.
4. Observe the Values given for each metric that makes up the CVSS score.

4. Research the CVSS ratings of the CWEs recorded in Part 1, Step 2.
    1. Navigate to [www.cve.org](http://www.cve.org).
    2. In the search box enter **CVE-2021-41617** and click **Find**.
    3. Scroll to bottom of the page and click **CVE-2021-41617** to view additional information on the NVD. This opens the National Vulnerability Database to view details about the CVE.
    4. Scroll to the **Severity** section and ensure that **CVSS Version 3.x** is selected.

Observe the values for the eight CVSS Base metrics in the **Vector**. The corresponding numerical score of these values combine to give a base score of 7.0 HIGH.

5. In a separate browser window, navigate to the CVSS 3.1 Calculator at [https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1).
6. In the Base Score calculator, click the metric names that correspond to the Vector on the NVD page. (**Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
