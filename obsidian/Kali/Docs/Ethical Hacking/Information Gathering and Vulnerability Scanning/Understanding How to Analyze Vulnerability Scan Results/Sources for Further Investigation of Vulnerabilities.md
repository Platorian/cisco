> **US=Cert**

The U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) was established to protect the Internet infrastructure of the United States. The main goal of US-CERT is to work with public- and private-sector agencies to increase the efficiency of vulnerability data sharing. The work done by US-CERT is meant to improve the nation’s cybersecurity posture. US-CERT operates as an entity under the Department of Homeland Security as part of the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC). You can access US-CERT resources by visiting _[https://www.us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov)_.

> **The CERT Division of Carnegie Mellon University**

The CERT Division of the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie Mellon University is a cybersecurity center whose experts help coordinate vulnerability disclosures across the industry. CERT researches security vulnerabilities and contributes to many different cybersecurity efforts in the industry. CERT also develops and delivers training to many organizations to help them improve their cybersecurity practices and programs. You can obtain additional information about CERT at _[https://cert.org](https://cert.org)_.

> **NIST**

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Its core focus is to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness. NIST is responsible for the creation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF; see _[https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)_). This framework includes a policy on computer security guidance. Version 1 of the NIST framework was published in 2014 for the purpose of guiding the security of critical infrastructure; however, it is commonly used by private industry for guidance in risk management. In 2018, NIST released version 1.1, which is designed to assist organizations in assessing the risks they encounter. In general, the framework outlines the standards and industry best practices that can be used to improve organizations’ cybersecurity posture. Anyone who is responsible for making decisions related to cybersecurity in an organization should consult this framework for guidance on standards and best practices.

> **JPCERT**

Similar to the US-CERT, the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team (JPCERT) is an organization that works with service providers, security vendors, and private-sector and government agencies to provide incident response capabilities, increase cybersecurity awareness, conduct research and analysis of security incidents, and work with other international CERT teams. The JPCERT is responsible for Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) activities in the Japanese and Asia Pacific region. You can access JP-CERT resources by visiting _[https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/)_.

> **CAPEC**

The Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) is a community-driven effort to catalog the attack patterns seen in the wild so that they can be used to more efficiently identify active threats. CAPEC, which is maintained by MITRE, acts as a dictionary of known attacks that have been seen in the real world.

> **CVE**

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is an effort that reaches across international cybersecurity communities. It was created in 1999 with the idea of consolidating cybersecurity tools and databases. A CVE ID is composed of the letters CVE followed by the year of publication and four or more digits in the sequence number portion of the ID (for example, CVE-YYYY-NNNN with four digits in the sequence number, CVE-YYYY-NNNNN with five digits in the sequence number, CVE-YYYY-NNNNNNN with seven digits in the sequence number, and so on). You can obtain additional information about CVE at _[https://cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org)_.

> **CWE**

Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), at a high level, is a list of software weaknesses. The purpose of CWE is to create a common language to describe software security weaknesses that are the root causes of given vulnerabilities. CWE provides a common baseline for weakness identification to aid the mitigation process. You can obtain additional information about CWE at MITRE’s site: _[https://cwe.mitre.org](https://cwe.mitre.org)_.

> **CVSS**

Each vulnerability represents a potential risk that threat actors can use to compromise your systems and your network. Each vulnerability carries an associated amount of risk. One of the most widely adopted standards for calculating the severity of a given vulnerability is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which has three components: base, temporal, and environmental scores. Each component is presented as a score on a scale from 0 to 10.

CVSS is an industry standard maintained by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) that is used by many Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs) to convey information about the severity of vulnerabilities they disclose to their customers. In CVSS, a vulnerability is evaluated according to three aspects, with a score assigned to each of them:

The base group represents the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and do not depend on a user-specific environment. This is the most important information and the only aspect that’s mandatory to obtain a vulnerability score. The temporal group assesses the vulnerability as it changes over time.  
The environmental group represents the characteristics of a vulnerability, taking into account the organizational environment.

The score for the base group is between 0 and 10, where 0 is the least severe and 10 is assigned to highly critical vulnerabilities. For example, a highly critical vulnerability could allow an attacker to remotely compromise a system and get full control. In addition, the score comes in the form of a vector string that identifies each of the components used to make up the score. The formula used to obtain the score takes into account various characteristics of the vulnerability and how the attacker is able to leverage these characteristics.

CVSS defines several characteristics for the base, temporal, and environmental groups. The base group defines Exploitability metrics that measure how the vulnerability can be exploited, as well as Impact metrics that measure the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In addition to these two metrics, a metric called Scope Change (S) is used to convey the impact on other systems that may be impacted by the vulnerability but do not contain the vulnerable code. For instance, if a router is susceptible to a DoS vulnerability and experiences a crash after receiving a crafted packet from the attacker, the scope is changed, since the devices behind the router will also experience the denial-of-service condition.
