You can easily identify domain technical and administrative contacts by using the Whois tool. Many organizations keep their registration details private and instead use the domain registrar organization contacts. For instance, let’s look at the technical and administrative contacts of h4cker.org (shown in Example 3-4). Omar Santos owns the h4cker.org domain; however, the technical and administrative details are private. Only the abuse contact email and phone number from Google (the domain registrar) are displayed.

Now let’s look at the Whois details for tesla.com, shown in Example 3-5.

The highlighted lines in Example 3-5 show the technical and administrative contacts for the domain (which are also the ones for the domain registrar [MarkMonitor]). Example 3-6 shows another example; this example shows the technical and administrative email contacts for the domain cisco.com.

In Example 3-6, the technical and administrative contacts are pointing to the InfoSec team at Cisco (infosec@cisco.com) instead of to the registrant.

**TIP** Various tools, such as Recon-ng, the Harvester, and Maltego, help automate the process of passive reconnaissance and support many DNS-based and Whois queries. Several of these tools are covered in Module 10 and are listed in Omar Santos' GitHub repository at [https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/tree/master/osint](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/tree/master/osint).
