A company can own a domain and related subdomain, but its applications might be hosted in the cloud. For example, Netflix (at the time of writing) owns the domain netflix.com, which resolves to IPv4 addresses 3.230.129.93, 52.3.144.142, and 54.237.226.164 (as demonstrated in Example 3-7 with the Linux **host** command).

However, the IPv4 addresses 3.230.129.93, 52.3.144.142, and 54.237.226.164 are owned by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which hosts Netflix.com, as demonstrated in Example 3-8.

In Example 3-8, the **whois** command is used to retrieve the organization name (OrgName) of the owner for each of the IP addresses 3.230.129.93, 52.3.144.142, and 54.237.226.164.
