**Reconnaissance**

Reconnaissance is always the initial step in a cyber attack. An attacker must first gather information about the target in order to be successful. In fact, the term **_reconnaissance_** is widely used in the military world to describe the gathering of information about the enemy, such as information about the enemy’s location, capabilities, and movements. This type of information is needed to successfully perform an attack. Reconnaissance in a penetration testing engagement typically consists of scanning and enumeration. But what does reconnaissance look like from an attacker’s perspective?

_“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”_

― Sun Tzu, The Art of War
