As a penetration tester, you can use tools like Wireshark, tshark, and tcpdump to collect packet captures for packet inspection and eavesdropping. Anyone who has been involved with networking or security has at some point used these tools to capture and analyze traffic on a network. For a penetration tester, such tools can be convenient for performing passive reconnaissance. Of course, this type of reconnaissance requires either a physical or a wireless connection to the target. If you are concerned about being detected, you are probably better off attempting a wireless connection because it would not require you to be inside the building. Many times, a company’s wireless footprint bleeds outside its physical walls. This gives a penetration tester an opportunity to potentially collect information about the target and possibly gain access to the network to sniff traffic. Module 5, “Exploiting Wired and Wireless Networks,” covers this topic in depth.
