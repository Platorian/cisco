n Module 6, “Exploiting Application-Based Vulnerabilities,” you learned that documents such as Swagger and the OpenAPI Specification documents can help you greatly when you’re assessing API implementations.

**NOTE** Swagger is a modern framework of API documentation and development that is the basis of the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). Additional information about Swagger can be obtained at [_https://swagger.io_](https://swagger.io). The OAS specification is available at [_https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification_](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).

**_Software development kits (SDKs)_** and cloud development kits (CDKs) can provide great insights about cloud-hosted applications, as well as the underlying infrastructure. An SDK is a collection of tools and resources to help with the creation of applications (on premises or in the cloud). SDKs often include compilers, debuggers, and other software frameworks.

CDKs, on the other hand, help software developers and cloud consumers deploy applications in the cloud and use the resources that the cloud provider offers. For example, the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework that cloud consumers and AWS customers use to define cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.

**NOTE** The following site provides detailed information on how to get started with the AWS CDK: [_https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html).
