The underlying mechanics and the attacker motive of a cloud account takeover attack are the same as for an account takeover that takes place on premises. In an **_account takeover_**, the threat actor gains access to a user or application account and uses it to then gain access to more accounts and information. There are different ways that an account takeover can happen in the cloud. The impact that an account takeover has in the cloud can also be a bit different from the impact of an on-premises attack. Some of the biggest differences are the organization’s ability to detect a cloud account takeover, find out what was impacted, and determine how to remediate and recover.

There are a number of ways to detect account takeover attacks. Select each for more detail.

The location of the user can clue you in to a takeover. For instance, you may not do business in certain geographic locations and countries.

An attacker could create a fake application that could require read, write, and send permissions for email SaaS offerings such as Office 365 and Gmail. Once the application is granted permission by the user to “connect” and authenticate to these services, the attacker could manipulate it.

You might suspect an account takeover attack if you notice that a particular user is suddenly sharing or downloading a large number of files.
