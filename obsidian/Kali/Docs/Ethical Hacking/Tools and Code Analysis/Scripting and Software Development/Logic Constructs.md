Programming logic constructs are the building blocks that include the sequence or order in which instructions occur and are processed, the path a program takes when it is running, and the iteration (or repeated execution) of a section of code.

Most programming languages include the following logic constructs:

**Loops** 

A loop is used to repeatedly execute a section of code. The most popular examples are **for** and **while** loops in different scripting languages like bash and programming languages like Python, Ruby, Perl, and JavaScript. You will learn more high-level concepts of these programming languages later in this module. Once again, this book is not intended to teach you a specific programming language. However, this module does provide you with a number of resources that will help you learn more about these programming concepts.


**Conditionals**

Conditionals are programming language commands that are used for handling decisions. The **if** statement in many programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, and Bash, is an example of a conditional statement, or conditional expression.

**Boolean Operators**

Also known as boolean conditionals, these operators are simple words (AND, OR, NOT, or AND NOT) that are used as conjunctions to combine or exclude keywords in a search, resulting in more focused and productive results. Using Boolean operators can save you time and effort by eliminating inappropriate hits that must be scanned only to be discarded.

**String Operators**

These operators allow you to manipulate values of variables in various useful ways. A good resource for learning about string operators in Python is _[https://realpython.com/lessons/string-operators](https://realpython.com/lessons/string-operators)_.

**Arithmetic Operators**

These operators perform mathematical operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus) on operands.

***TIP*** One of the best resources for learning about different programming languages and related concepts is w3schools.com. For instance, the following link provides details about for loops in Python: _[https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp)_.

Omar Santos has also added a large number of resources and tutorials about different programming concepts in his GitHub repository, at [_https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/tree/master/programming_and_scripting_for_cybersecurity_](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker/tree/master/programming_and_scripting_for_cybersecurity).
