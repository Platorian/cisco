Authorization concerns the actions that users are permitted to do. While users might successfully authenticate to a system with their username and password, they may not be allowed to access certain resources, change or delete data, or change system settings. Only users with appropriate authorization are allowed to do these things.

Users of web applications are frequently able to interact with the application without being authenticated. It is assumed that these users are only authorized to do normal user actions like submitting search queries, adding comments, registering for email notifications, etc. However, there are vulnerabilities that enable unauthenticated users to do things that only authenticated system administrators or developers are authorized to do.

We can test for these vulnerabilities. Our engagement with Pixel Paradise includes testing their web applications for authorization-based vulnerabilities.

Two of the most common authorization-based vulnerabilities are parameter pollution and Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerabilities. The following sections provide details about these vulnerabilities.
