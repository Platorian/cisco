Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of injection attack in which web applications accept malicious scripts that are often appended to a URL or inserted into user-supplied text that is displayed to all visitors to a web page. Injection attacks are among the top security risks in the OWASP Top 10, with XSS a major contributor. We must check for XSS vulnerabilities when we are hired to test web application security.

Pixel Paradise runs a storefront web application to sell games and collectable merchandise to fans of its products. It also accepts reviews of its products from its customers. We need to determine that these applications are not vulnerable to XSS. Read this material and do the lab to learn more about these vulnerabilities and some approaches for testing for them.

**_Cross-site scripting_** **_(XSS)_** vulnerabilities, which have become some of the most common web application vulnerabilities, are achieved using the following attack types:

- Reflected XSS
- Stored (persistent) XSS
- DOM-based XSS

Successful exploitation could result in installation or execution of malicious code, account compromise, session cookie hijacking, revelation or modification of local files, or site redirection.

**NOTE** The results of XSS attacks are the same regardless of the vector.

You typically find XSS vulnerabilities in the following:

- Search fields that echo a search string back to the user
- HTTP headers
- Input fields that echo user data
- Error messages that return user-supplied text
- Hidden fields that may include user input data
- Applications (or websites) that display user-supplied data

The following example shows an XSS test that can be performed from a browserâ€™s address bar:


```java
javascript:alert("Omar_s_XSS test");
javascript:alert(document.cookie);
```


The following example shows an XSS test that can be performed in a user input field in a web form:

```java
<script>alert("XSS Test")</script>
```

**NOTE** Attackers can use obfuscation techniques in XSS attacks by encoding tags or malicious portions of the script using Unicode so that the link or HTML content is disguised to the end user browsing the site.
