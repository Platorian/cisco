**_Reflected XSS_** attacks (that is, non-persistent XSS attacks) occur when malicious code or scripts are injected by a vulnerable web application using any method that yields a response as part of a valid HTTP request. An example of a reflected XSS attack is a user being persuaded to follow a malicious link to a vulnerable server that injects (reflects) the malicious code back to the user’s browser. This causes the browser to execute the code or script. In this case, the vulnerable server is usually a known or trusted site.

**NOTE** Examples of methods of delivery for XSS exploits are phishing emails, messaging applications, and search engines.

Figure 6-18 illustrates the steps in a reflected XSS attack.

**Step 1.** The attacker finds a vulnerability in the web server.

**Step 2.** The attacker sends a malicious link to the victim.

**Step 3.** The victim clicks on the malicious link, and the attack is sent to the vulnerable server.

**Step 4.** The attack is reflected to the victim and is executed.

**Step 5.** The victim sends information (depending on the attack) to the attacker.

**TIP** You can practice XSS scenarios with WebGoat. You can easily test a reflected XSS attack by using the following link:

http://**localhost**:8080/WebGoat/CrossSiteScripting/attack5a?QTY1=1&QTY2=1&QTY3=1&QTY4=1&field1=4128+3214+0002  
+1999&field2=111

Replace **localhost** with the hostname or IP address of the system running WebGoat.

**Q.** The IT help desk received a report from an employee that a suspicious email was circulating. A network analyst reviewed the email and noticed that the message contained a phishing link that asked users to visit a website. On further investigation, the analyst noticed that the website is a vulnerable web server, and the phishing link would cause the response from the web server to contain malicious code. Which type of attack would occur if users click the phishing link?

**A.** Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when malicious code or scripts are injected by a vulnerable web application using any method that yields a response as part of a valid HTTP request. An example of a reflected XSS attack is when a user follows a malicious link to a vulnerable server that injects (reflects) the malicious code back into the user's browser, causing the browser to execute the code or script.
