Unvalidated redirects and forwards are vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to attack a web application and its clients. The attacker can exploit such vulnerabilities when a web server accepts untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect the request to a URL contained within untrusted input. The attacker can modify the untrusted URL input and redirect the user to a malicious site to either install malware or steal sensitive information.

It is also possible to use unvalidated redirect and forward vulnerabilities to craft a URL that can bypass application access control checks. This, in turn, allows an attacker to access privileged functions that he or she would normally not be permitted to access.

**NOTE** Unvalidated redirect and forward attacks often require a little bit of social engineering.
