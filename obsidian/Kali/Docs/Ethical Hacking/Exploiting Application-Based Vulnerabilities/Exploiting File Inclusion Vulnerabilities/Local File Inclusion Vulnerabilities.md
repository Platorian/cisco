A local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability occurs when a web application allows a user to submit input into files or upload files to the server. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read and (in some cases) execute files on the victim’s system. Some LFI vulnerabilities can be critical if a web application is running with high privileges or as root. Such vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive information and can even enable them to execute arbitrary commands in the affected system.

Figure 6-22 from the previous topic and repeated below shows an example of a directory traversal vulnerability, but the same application also has an LFI vulnerability: The **/etc/passwd** file can be shown in the application page due to an LFI flaw
