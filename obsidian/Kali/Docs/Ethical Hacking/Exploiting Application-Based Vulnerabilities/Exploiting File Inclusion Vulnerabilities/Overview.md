**Protego Security Solutions**

We need to assess Pixel Paradise’s weakness to local and remote file inclusion (LFI/RFI) vulnerabilities. We believe that web site and network users should not be able to access any files beyond those that are needed for the user’s role. The ability to read or execute even one file without authorization means that there are probably many more that can also be accessed, either at the present time, or in the future.

We will apply this standard to our engagement with Pixel Paradise. We are especially concerned that their web applications use scripting run times. We know that their game review forum permits uploading of files from users. This is another potential source for file inclusion vulnerabilities.
