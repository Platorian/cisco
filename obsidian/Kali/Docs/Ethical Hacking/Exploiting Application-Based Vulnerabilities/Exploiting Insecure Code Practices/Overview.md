**Protego Security Solutions**

Because most university computer science departments do not emphasize security in their software development courses, many developers, especially new graduates, are unaware of their role in preventing cybersecurity incidents.

While organizations may use some sort of source code and binaries pre-deployment security scanning, unless developers are directly involved in remediating their own insecure practices, they are likely to repeat their mistakes.

Some software development organizations the use DevOps practices include automated source code scanning every time developers’ work is committed to a code repository and every time binaries are submitted to build repositories. This enables what is called a shift-left approach to software security in which developers take an active responsibility for enhancing security in their own code based on feedback from these scanners.

We can only hope! We have not been informed of how Pixel Paradise ensures that their code is developed with security in mind, but we will find out!

The following sections cover several insecure code practices that attackers can exploit and that you can leverage during a penetration testing engagement.
