Many ethical and malicious hackers use web proxies to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications. A **_web proxy_**, in this context, is a piece of software that is typically installed in the attacker’s system to intercept, modify, or delete transactions between a web browser and a web application. Figure 6-24 shows how a web proxy works.

Two of the most popular web proxies used to hack web applications are Burp Suite and ZAP. Burp Suite is a collection of tools and capabilities, one of which is a web proxy.

**Burp Suite**, also simply known as “Burp,” comes in two different versions: the free Burp Suite Community Edition and the paid Burp Suite Professional Edition. Figure 6-25 shows the Burp Suite Community Edition being used to intercept transactions from the attacker’s web browser and a web application. You can see how session cookies and other information can be intercepted and captured in the proxy.

**TIP** Burp Suite was created by a company called PortSwigger, which has a very comprehensive (and free) web application security online course at [_https://portswigger.net/web-security_](https://portswigger.net/web-security). This course provides free labs and other materials that can help you prepare for the PenTest+ and other certifications.

**OWASP ZAP** is a collection of tools including proxy, automated scanning, fuzzing, and other capabilities that can be used to find vulnerabilities in web applications. You can download OWASP ZAP, which is free, from [_https://www.zaproxy.org_](https://www.zaproxy.org). Figure 6-26 shows how OWASP ZAP is used to perform an automated scan of a vulnerable web application. In this example, OWASP ZAP found two vulnerable JavaScript libraries that an attacker could leverage to compromise the web application.

Earlier in this module, you learned about the tool DirBuster, which can be used to perform active reconnaissance of a web application. There are other, more modern tools available to perform similar reconnaissance (including enumerating files and directories). The following are some of the most popular of them:

- **gobuster:** This tool, which is similar to DirBuster, is written in Go. You can download gobuster from [_https://github.com/OJ/gobuster_](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster).
- **ffuf:** This very fast web fuzzer is also written in Go. You can download ffuf from [_https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf_](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf).
- **feroxbuster:** This web application reconnaissance fuzzer is written in Rust. You can download feroxbuster from [_https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster_](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster).

All of these tools use wordlists – that is, files containing numerous words that are used to enumerate files and, directories and crack passwords. Figure 6-27 shows how gobuster is able to enumerate different directories in a web application running on port 8888 on a system with the IP address 192.168.88.225. The attacker in this case is using a wordlist called mywordlist.

Practice - Web Hacking Tools

**Q.** You are looking for tools to use in a penetration test of a customer's web application. You want the software to intercept and forward all traffic between your testing VM and the customer's web site so you can examine and analyze all of the messages that are exchanged. Which tools should you consider? (Choose all that apply.)

**A.** Two of the most popular web proxies that are used to hack web applications are Burp Suite and ZAP. Burp Suite is a collection of tools and capabilities, one of which is a web proxy. OWASP ZAP is a collection of tools, including proxy, automated scanning, fuzzing, and others, that can be used to find vulnerabilities in web applications.
