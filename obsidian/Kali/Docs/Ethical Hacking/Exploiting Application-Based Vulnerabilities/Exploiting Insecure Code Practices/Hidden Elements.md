Web application parameter tampering attacks can be executed by manipulating parameters exchanged between the web client and the web server in order to modify application data. This could be achieved by manipulating cookies (as discussed earlier in this module) and by abusing hidden form fields.

It might be possible to tamper with the values stored by a web application in hidden form fields. Letâ€™s take a look at an example of a hidden HTML form field. Suppose that the following is part of an e-commerce site selling merchandise to online customers:

```html
<input type="hidden" id="123" name="price" value="100.00">
```

In the hidden field shown in this example, an attacker could potentially edit the **value** information to reduce the price of an item. Not all hidden fields are bad; in some cases, they are useful for the application, and they can even be used to protect against CSRF attacks.
