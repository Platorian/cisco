_Cookie manipulation attacks_ are often referred to as _stored DOM-based attacks_ (or _vulnerabilities_ ). Cookie manipulation is possible when vulnerable applications store user input and then embed that input in a response within a part of the DOM. This input is later processed in an unsafe manner by a client-side script. An attacker can use a JavaScript string (or other scripts) to trigger the DOM-based vulnerability. Such scripts can write controllable data into the value of a cookie.

An attacker can take advantage of stored DOM-based vulnerabilities to create a URL that sets an arbitrary value in a userâ€™s cookie.

**NOTE** The impact of a stored DOM-based vulnerability depends on the role that the cookie plays within the application.

**TIP** A best practice for avoiding cookie manipulation attacks is to avoid dynamically writing to cookies using data originating from untrusted sources.
