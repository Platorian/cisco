Which NetBIOS service is used for connection-oriented communication?

NetBIOS provides three different services:  

- NetBIOS Name Service (NetBIOS-NS) for name registration and resolution
- Datagram Service (NetBIOS-DGM) for connectionless communication
- Session Service (NetBIOS-SSN) for connection-oriented communication

Match the port type and number with the respective NetBIOS protocol service.

What two features are present on DNS servers using BIND 9.5.0 and higher that help mitigate DNS cache poisoning attacks? (Choose two.)

DNS servers using BIND 9.5.0 and higher provide features that help prevent DNS cache poisoning attacks. These features include the randomization of ports and provision of cryptographically secure DNS transaction identifiers. Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), a technology developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), provides secure DNS data authentication and protects against DNS cache poisoning.

What UDP port number is used by SNMP protocol?

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol that many individuals and organisations use to manage network devices. SNMP uses UDP port 161.

Which is a characteristic of a DNS poisoning attack?

DNS cache poisoning involves the manipulation of the DNS resolver cache through the injection of corrupted DNS data. This is done to force the DNS server to send the wrong IP address to the victim and redirect the victim to the attacker system.

Which Kali Linux tool or script can gather information on devices configured for SNMP?

The Kali Linux snmp-check tool can perform an SNMP walk to gather information on devices configured for SNMP.

Match the SMTP command with the respective description.

Which two best practices would help mitigate FTP server abuse and attacks? (Choose two.)

The following are several additional best practices for mitigating FTP server abuse and attacks:

- Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication. A best practice is to use good credential management and strong passwords. When possible, use two-factor authentication for any critical service or server.
- Implement file and folder security, making sure that users have access to only the files they are entitled to access.
- Use encryption at restâ€”encrypt all files stored in the FTP server.
- Lock down administration accounts. You should restrict administrator privileges to a limited number of users and require them to use multifactor authentication. In addition, do not use common administrator usernames such as root or admin.
- Keep the FTPS or SFTP server software up-to-date.
- Use the U.S. government FIPS 140-2 validated encryption ciphers for general guidance on what encryption algorithms to use.
- Keep any back-end databases on a different server than the FTP server.
- Require re-authentication of inactive sessions.
- Disable anonymous logins.

Which is a characteristic of the pass-the-hash attack?

The Windows operating system does not know the actual password because it stores only a hash of the password in the SAM database. Since Windows password hashes cannot be reversed, an attacker can just use a password hash collected from a compromised system and then use the same hash to log in to another client or server system.

What is a Kerberoasting attack?

Kerberoasting is a post-exploitation activity that an attacker uses to extract service account credential hashes from Active Directory for offline cracking.

Match the attack type with the respective description.

Which tool can be used to perform a Disassociation attack?

Airmon-ng (part of the Aircrack-ng suite) can perform wireless reconnaissance and disassociation attacks. The Aircrack-ng suite of tools can be downloaded from [https://www.aircrack-ng.org](https://www.aircrack-ng.org).

Which is a characteristic of a Bluesnarfing attack?

An attack that can be performed using Bluetooth with vulnerable devices in range.This attack actually steals information from the victim's device. It can also be used to obtain a device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number.

Which Wi-Fi protocol is most vulnerable to a brute-force attack during a Wi-Fi network deployment?

Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a protocol that simplifies the deployment of wireless. Most implementations do not care if millions of PIN combinations are incorrectly attempted in a row, which means these devices are most susceptible to brute-force attacks.

What does the MFP feature in the 802.11w standard do to protect against wireless attacks?

The 802.11w standard defines the Management Frame Protection (MFP) feature. MFP protects wireless devices against spoofed management frames from other devices that might otherwise deauthenticate a valid user session.

What is a DNS resolver cache on a Windows system?

A DNS resolver cache is a temporary database maintained by Windows that contains records of all the recent visits and attempted visits to websites and other internet domains.

Match the TCP port number with the respective email protocol that uses it.

![[Pasted image 20240614125230.png]]

Which is the default TCP port used in SMTP for non-encrypted communications?

The following TCP ports are used in most common email protocols:  
TCP port 25: The default port used in SMTP for non-encrypted communications.  
TCP port 465: The port registered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for SMTP over SSL (SMTPS).  
TCP port 587: The Secure SMTP (SSMTP) protocol for encrypted communications, as defined in RFC 2487, using STARTTLS.  
TCP port 110: The default port used by the POP3 protocol in non-encrypted communications.  
TCP port 995: The default port used by the POP3 protocol in encrypted communications.  
TCP port 143: The default port used by the IMAP protocol in non-encrypted communications.  
TCP port 993: The default port used by the IMAP protocol in encrypted (SSL/TLS) communications.

What is a characteristic of a Kerberos silver ticket attack?

The Kerberos silver ticket attack uses forged service tickets for a given service on a particular server.

Which attack is a post-exploitation activity that an attacker uses to extract service account credential hashes from Active Directory for offline cracking?

Kerberoasting is a post-exploitation activity used by an attacker to extract service account credential hashes from Active Directory for offline cracking. It is a pervasive attack that exploits a combination of weak encryption implementations and improper password practices.

Which four items are needed by an attacker to create a silver ticket for a Kerberos silver ticket attack? (Choose four.)

To create a silver ticket, you need the system account (ending in $), the security identifier (SID) for the domain, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), and the given service (for example, CIFS, HOST).

Which kind of attack is an IP spoofing attack?

The On-path attack intercepts communications between two systems. The attacker splits the original TCP connection into 2 new connections, one between the client and the attacker and the other between the attacker and the server. This often uses IP spoofing to trick a victim into connecting to the attack.

What is a common mitigation practice for ARP cache poisoning attacks on switches to prevent spoofing of Layer 2 addresses?

A common mitigation for ARP cache poisoning attacks is to use Dynamic Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Inspection (DAI) on switches to prevent spoofing of the Layer 2 addresses.

An attacker is launching a reflected DDoS attack in which the response traffic is made up of packets that are much larger than those that the attacker initially sent. Which type of attack is this?

An amplification attack is a form of reflected DoS attack in which the response traffic (sent by the unwitting participant) is made up of packets much larger than those initially sent by the attacker (spoofing the victim). The result is that the victim machine gets flooded by large packets for which it never actually issued queries, causing a denial of services.
