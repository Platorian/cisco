The purpose of **_jamming_** wireless signals or causing wireless network interference is to create a full or partial DoS condition in the wireless network. Such a condition, if successful, is very disruptive. Most modern wireless implementations provide built-in features that can help immediately detect such attacks. In order to jam a Wi-Fi signal or any other type of radio communication, an attacker basically generates random noise on the frequencies that wireless networks use. With the appropriate tools and wireless adapters that support packet injection, an attacker can cause legitimate clients to disconnect from wireless infrastructure devices.
