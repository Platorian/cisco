Credential harvesting is an attack that involves obtaining or compromising user credentials. Credential harvesting attacks can be launched using common social engineering attacks such as phishing attacks, and they can be performed by impersonating a wireless AP or a captive portal to convince a user to enter his or her credentials.

Tools such as Ettercap can spoof DNS replies and divert a user visiting a given website to an attacker’s local system. For example, an attacker might spoof a site like Twitter, and when the user visits the website (which looks like the official Twitter website), he or she is prompted to log in, and the attacker captures the user’s credentials. Another tool that enables this type of attack is the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET), which you learned about in Module 4, “Social Engineering Attacks.”
