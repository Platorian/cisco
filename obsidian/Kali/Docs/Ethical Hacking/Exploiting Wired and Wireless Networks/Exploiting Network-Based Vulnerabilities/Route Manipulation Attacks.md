Although many different route manipulation attacks exist, one of the most common is the BGP hijacking attack. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a dynamic routing protocol used to route Internet traffic. An attacker can launch a BGP hijacking attack by configuring or compromising an edge router to announce prefixes that have not been assigned to his or her organization. If the malicious announcement contains a route that is more specific than the legitimate advertisement or that presents a shorter path, the victimâ€™s traffic could be redirected to the attacker. In the past, threat actors have leveraged unused prefixes for BGP hijacking in order to avoid attention from the legitimate user or organization. Figure 5-6 illustrates a BGP hijacking route manipulation attack. The attacker compromises a router and performs a BGP hijack attack to intercept traffic between Host A and Host B.
