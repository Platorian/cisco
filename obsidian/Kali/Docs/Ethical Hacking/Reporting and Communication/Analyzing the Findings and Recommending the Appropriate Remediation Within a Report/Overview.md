**Protego Security Solutions**

Most penetration tests require recommendations for remediation. It is not enough to just find issues. We also need to provide our expertise to help our clients address the issues that we find.

Our recommendations may be technical, but can also be organizational. Many issues can be addressed through changes in policies and procedures. Sometimes our clients need to staff new positions or enhance the skill sets of existing employees. For other issues, staff training can be an appropriate recommendation in order to enhance protections against social engineering attacks.

You should match each vulnerability that you find to recommendations for mitigation. It is also valuable to provide relative risk ratings to help the client prioritize the actions that they must take. At this point in the engagement, we consider ourselves to be in a helping relationship with our clients.

During a penetration testing engagement, you should analyze the findings and recommend the appropriate remediation within your report, including technical, administrative, operational, and physical controls.
