**Client Acceptance**
You should have written documentation of your clientâ€™s acceptance of your report and related deliverables.

**Lessons Learned** 
It is important to analyze and present any lessons learned during the penetration testing engagement.

**Follow-Up Actions/Retest**
Your client may ask you to retest different applications or systems after you provide the report. You should follow up and take care of any action items in an agreed appropriate time frame.

**Attestation of Findings**
You should provide clear acknowledgement proving that the assessment was performed and reporting your findings.

**Data Destruction Process**
You need to destroy any client sensitive data as agreed in the pre-engagement activities.

Practice - Post Report Delivery

**Q.** Our testing engagement with Pixel Paradise is coming to a close. They have signed-off on our final report and it is time to clean up. You are needed to help out. What activities will you be participating in? (Choose all that apply.)

**A.** Activities that should be performed after the penetration test and after delivery of the report to the client include, amongst other activities, removing tester-created credentials, removing shells spawned on exploited systems, removing any tools installed or run from the systems under test, and destroying any copied client sensitive data.
