Well, the Pixel Paradise test is almost over. They have accepted the final report and we delivered our presentation of findings to the stakeholders. They seem happy with the quality of the work we did, but not so happy about some of the findings. That's good, because it looks like they will accept our recommendations and make important improvements to their security posture.

The last thing that we need to do is restore their systems to the state that they were in before we started our tests. This is another reason why it is important to carefully document our procedures as we conduct the test. We need to be sure to restore their systems, remove any files or accounts that we created, and get rid of the testing software and simulated malware that we installed. In addition, we did exfiltrate one file. But that has already been destroyed. Once we have cleaned everything up, get ready for the next job. It will be a good one!
