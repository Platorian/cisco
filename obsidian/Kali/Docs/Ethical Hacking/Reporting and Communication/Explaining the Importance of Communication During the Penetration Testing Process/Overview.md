**Protego Security Solutions**

No one works in a vacuum. Here at Protego, we are always aware that we are providing a service to our customers. Without them, we don’t exist. What’s more, because many of us have worked in various cybersecurity-related positions within other companies, we understand the challenges that organizations face as they work to defend themselves against what seems like an endless number of threats and threat actors.

We always want to keep in touch with our clients as we conduct our testing engagements. Some security personnel will likely be anxious that they could be accused of professional negligence because of the vulnerabilities that we find. Management is concerned about the time it takes to conduct a test and any costs that could occur if the vulnerabilities that we discover could require expensive software upgrades or system down time.

We think it is effective to schedule regular check-in meetings with our customers so that they know how the test is going. We also work to open less formal channels of communication with cybersecurity personnel in order to help them feel more comfortable with what we are doing and to find answers to questions that might come up during the test.

In a formal sense, our penetration testing agreements establish how we intend to communicate during the test, and with whom. We also establish who on the client team should be informed if we discover indicators of prior compromise. Finally, we list the stakeholders at the organization who should receive the final report and attend the closing presentation.

The report is the final deliverable in a penetration test. It communicates all the activities performed during the test as well as the ultimate results in the form of findings and recommendations. The report is, however, not the only form of communication that you will have with a client during a penetration testing engagement. During the testing phases of the engagement, certain situations may arise in which you need to have a plan for communication and escalation.

In Module 2, “Planning and Scoping a Penetration Testing Assessment,” you learned how to scope a penetration testing engagement properly. You may encounter a scope creep situation if there is poor change management in the penetration testing engagement. In addition, scope creep can surface through ineffective identification of the technical and nontechnical elements that will be required for the penetration test. Poor communication among stakeholders, including your client and your own team, can also contribute to scope creep.

It is extremely important that you understand the _communication path_ and communication channels with your client. You should always have good open lines of communication with your client and the stakeholders that hired you, including the following:

- **Primary contact:** This is the stakeholder who hired you or the main contact identified by the person who hired you.
- **Technical contacts:** You should document any IT staff or security analysts/engineers that you might need to contact for assistance during the testing.
- **Emergency contacts:** You should clearly document who should be contacted in case of an emergency.
