With _piggybacking_, an unauthorized person tags along with an authorized person to gain entry to a restricted area – usually with the person’s consent. **_Tailgating_** is essentially the same but with one difference: It usually occurs without the authorized person’s consent. Both piggybacking and tailgating can be defeated through the use of access control vestibules (formerly known as mantraps). An access control vestibule is a small space that can usually fit only one person. It has two sets of closely spaced doors; the first set must be closed before the other will open, creating a sort of waiting room where people are identified (and cannot escape). Access control vestibules are often used in server rooms and data centers. Multifactor authentication is often used in conjunction with an access control vestibule; for example, a proximity card and PIN may be required at the first door and a biometric scan at the second.

**TIP** An access control vestibule is an example of a preventive security control. Turnstiles, double entry doors, and security guards can also eliminate piggybacking and tailgating and help address confidentiality in general. These options tend to be less expensive and less effective than access control vestibules.
