**Protego Security Solutions**

Physical security is often overlooked. A client can have the most elaborate cybersecurity infrastructure, but if a threat actor can physically enter a facility and gain access to the network or systems, the security infrastructure is rendered ineffective.

At Protego, we are sometimes asked to evaluate physical security. This involves evaluating physical entry points to facilities, perimeter security including video surveillance and fencing, and policies and knowledge that guide employees in detecting and preventing unauthorized access and theft of assets. Sometimes we even send a tester to the facility with the goal of gaining unauthorized entry through various means.

As a penetration tester or red teamer, you might be asked to simulate what a real-world threat actor or criminal can to do compromise an organization’s physical security in order to gain access to infrastructure, buildings, systems, and employees. In this section, you will learn about various types of physical attacks.
