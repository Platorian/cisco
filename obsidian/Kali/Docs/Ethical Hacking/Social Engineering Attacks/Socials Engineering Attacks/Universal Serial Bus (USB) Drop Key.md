Many pen testers and attackers have used **_Universal Serial Bus (USB) drop key_** attacks to successfully compromise victim systems. This type of attack involves just leaving USB sticks (sometimes referred to as USB keys or USB pen drives) unattended or placing them in strategic locations. Oftentimes, users think that the devices are lost and insert them into their systems to figure out whom to return the devices to; before they know it, they are downloading and installing malware. Plugging in that USB stick you found lying around on the street outside your office could lead to a security breach.

Research by Elie Bursztein, of Googleâ€™s anti-abuse research team, shows that the majority of users will plug USB drives into their system without hesitation. As part of his research, he dropped close to 300 USB sticks on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus and measured who plugged in the drives. The results showed that 98% of the USB drives were picked up, and for 45% of the drives, someone not only plugged in the drive but clicked on files.

Another social engineering technique involves dropping a key ring containing a USB stick that may also include pictures of kids or pets and an actual key or two. These types of personal touches may prompt a victim to try to identify the owner in order to return the key chain. This type of social engineering attack is very effective and also can be catastrophic.
