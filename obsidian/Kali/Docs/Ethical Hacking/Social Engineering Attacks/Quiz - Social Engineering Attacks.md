**Q.** Which social engineering physical attack statement is correct?

**A.** There are various types of physical attacks. With piggybacking, unauthorized person tags along with an authorized person to gain entry to a restricted area, usually with the person's consent. Tailgating is the same but usually occurs without the authorized consent of the person. In badge cloning attacks, specialized software and hardware can perform such attacks. With shoulder surfing, someone obtains information such as personally identifiable information, passwords, and other confidential data by looking over the shoulder of the victim. There are special screen filters for computer displays to prevent someone from seeing the screen at an angle.

**Q.** Which tool provides a threat actor a web console to manipulate users who are victims of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks?

**A.** Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) is a tool that can be used to manipulate users by leveraging XSS vulnerabilities. The tool starts a web service on port 3000 by default. From there, the attacker can log in to a web console and manipulate users who are victims of XSS attacks.

---

**Q.** Which Apple iOS and Android tool can be used to spoof a phone number?

**A.** Several call spoofing tools can be used in social engineering attacks. SpoofApp is an Apple iOS and Android app that can easily spoof a phone number. Asterisk is a legitimate VoIP management tool that can also be used to impersonate caller ID. BeEF and Nessus are not called spoofing tools.

---

**Q.** What two physical attacks are mitigated by using access control vestibules? (Choose two.)

**A.** Piggybacking and tailgating can be defeated through access control vestibules, formerly mantraps. An access control vestibule is a small space that usually fits only one person. It has two sets of closely spaced doors; the first set must be closed before the other will open, creating a sort of waiting room where people are identified (and cannot escape).

---

**Q.** Which two access control options are commonly used in conjunction with access control vestibules? (Choose two.)

**A.** Multifactor authentication is often used in conjunction with an access control vestibule. For example, a proximity card and PIN may be required at the first door and a biometric scan at the second.

---

**Q.** Which resource would mitigate piggybacking and tailgating?

**A.** An access control vestibule is an example of a preventive security control. Turnstiles, double entry doors, and security guards can eliminate piggybacking and tailgating and help address confidentiality. These options are less expensive and less effective than access control vestibules.

---

**Q.** Which tool can launch social engineering attacks and be integrated with third-party tools and frameworks such as Metasploit?

**A.** Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) is a tool that can be used to launch numerous social engineering attacks and can be integrated with third-party tools and frameworks such as Metasploit. SET is installed by default in Kali Linux and Parrot Security.

---

**Q.** Who is the target of a whaling attack?

**A.** Whaling is an attack targeted at a company's high-profile business executives and key individuals. The main goal in whaling attacks is to steal sensitive information or compromise the victim's system and then target other key high-profile victims.

---

**Q.** A threat actor has sent a text message to a victim stating that they have won bitcoins in a bank contest. To claim their prize, the victim must click the provided link and enter their bank account information. What social engineering attack can be accomplished if the user enters their banking information?

**Q.** A new employee is celebrating their position with a large company by posting a picture of their access identification on social media. What kind of physical attack has the new employee unknowingly enabled?

**A.** Attackers can perform different badge cloning attacks. Attackers can often leverage pictures of people´s badges on social media.

**Q.** A user has found a USB pen drive in the corporate parking lot. What should the user do with this pen drive?

**A.** Many pen testers and attackers have used Universal Serial Bus (USB) drop key attacks to successfully compromise victim systems. This attack involves leaving USB sticks (USB keys or USB pen drives) unattended or placing these pen drives in strategic locations. Frequently, users think these devices are lost and insert these pen drives into the systems to figure out whom to return the devices to;w it, they download before they know and install malware. Plugging in that USB stick lying on the street outside an office could lead to a security breach. The best thing to do is to deliver the pen drive to the security sector of the company.
