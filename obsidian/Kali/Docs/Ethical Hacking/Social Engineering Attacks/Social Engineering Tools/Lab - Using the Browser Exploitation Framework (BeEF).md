**Protego Security Solutions Task**

Another great tool in your Kali distribution is the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF). We installed it for you so that you are ready to try it out. BeEF is an application that runs in your browser. It allows you to take control of target browsers that visit a malicious web page that you have created. From there, a large number of exploits can be executed that affect the target browser.

In combination with social engineering attacks such as phishing emails, BeEF is an effective tool for information gathering, distributing malware, and many other browser-based exploits. We use it to gain access to an organization’s internal network and it is really useful for illustrating the extent to which social engineering can result in very big problems!

Do this lab and study BeEF further. I am interested in hearing how you think we can use it in our Pixel Paradise engagement as we move into the exploitation phase of our engagement.

In this lab, you will complete the following objectives:

- Load the BeEF GUI Environment
- Hook the Local Browser to Simulate a Client-Side Attack
- Investigate BeEF Exploit Capabilities

---

## Part 1: Load the BeEF GUI Environment

### Step 1: Start BeEF.

1. Open the BeEF application from the Kali **Application > All Applications > beef start** menu choice. The first time BeEF is run, you will be prompted to change the password for the BeEF user. Enter **newbeef** as the password.

```
sudo beef-xss
```

[sudo] password for kali:

[-] You are using the Default credentials

[-] (Password must be different from "beef")

[-] Please type a new password for the beef user: **newbeef**

At the end of the command output, BeEF indicates that is opening the BeEF web UI in a new browser window.

[*] Opening Web UI (http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/panel) in: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

2. A browser window will open automatically. This is the BeEF interface. If it does not, open Firefox from the menu bar and enter **http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/authentication** as the URL. Log in to BeEF with the username **beef** and the password **newbeef**.

### Step 2: Hook the Local Browser to Simulate a Client-Side Attack.

To use BeEF to exploit a target system, you first have to “hook” the target browser. You will use the local system as the target in this lab. If you were running an actual penetration test, your reconnaissance would identify web pages that the user may visit often, as in a watering hole attack. You would use one of the commonly visited web pages to deliver the “beef hook” JavaScript code. In this lab, you will use a demo web page that is included with the BeEF application.

1. Open a new tab in your Firefox browser. Enter the URL **http://127.0.0.1:3000/demos/butcher/index.html**.

The fake web page resembles a simple storefront app. It contains JavaScript code which will run in the browser environment when the page is loaded.

2. Use **CTRL-U** in Firefox to view the source code for the HTML page that is displayed.

- Return to the browser window that contains the **BeEF Control Panel**. Notice that the information in the **Hooked Browsers** panel on the left side of the screen has changed.
- Click the entry listed under **Online Browsers**.

Open the **Details** tab. What information does BeEF know about the target user’s computer and browser? Why is this information interesting?

## Part 2: Investigate BeEF Exploit Capabilities

### Step 1: Investigate the Commands and Network Tabs.

In this step, you will investigate two of the tabs that appear for the hooked internal browser. Use the internet to research the capabilities of the other tabs.

1. Click the **Commands** tab. This tab is where modules can be executed against the target browser. Expand the command categories in the **Module Tree** pane. Notice the color-coded icons next to each function. These icons are referred to as “traffic lights”.

Each command module has a traffic light icon, which is used to indicate the following:

**Green**         The command module works against the target and should be invisible to the user.

**Orange**       The command module works against the target but may be visible to the user.

**White**         The command module is yet to be verified against this target.

**Red**            The command module does not work against this target.


**Note**: The Module Tree search box acts as a filter. If you use the search box to find a command, you must clear your search terms from the box to see the entire tree again.

2. Click the **Network** tab. The BeEF console creates a network map displaying the current network topology. The other tabs in this category are Hosts and Services. Because you are working in a local environment only, the network map will only show one network and one host.

---

### Step 2: Use BeEF to Initiate a Social Engineering Attack.

In this step, you will send a fake alert message to the hooked browser window to entice the user to download and install a malicious plug-in.

1. Click the **Commands** tab in the **BeEF Control Panel**. Scroll down to the **Social Engineering** category. Open the category. Select the **Fake Notification Bar (Firefox)** choice from the module list. The default URL for the malicious plug-in is listed along with the message that will be shown on the browser window. The exploit will cause an alert to display on the browser. If the user clicks the install button for the fake plug-in, they will be directed to the URL listed.

- Change **Plugin URL** to **http://10.6.6.13/**. This URL redirects the user to the login screen for the DVWA virtual server. The URL can point to any webpage, either locally stored or on the network. In a live penetration testing environment, this would be a cloned website, a malicious application download, or a webpage containing a malicious script.
- Change the alert text to say **AdBlocker Security Extension is out of date. Install the new version now.** Click **Execute** to send the alert to the hooked browser window.
- Return to the browser tab that displays **The Butcher** fake web page. An alert message is on the Firefox banner area. Click the **Install Plug-in** button on the alert banner.

### Step 3: Use TabNabbing to Display Malicious Website

TabNabbing is a function that redirects the user to a different URL if a browser tab of a hooked browser is idle for a specified length of time.

1. Open a new instance of Firefox. Navigate to the BeEF login screen using the URL **http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/authentication**. Log in with the username of **beef** and the password of **newbeef.**
2. Open a new tab and navigate back to **The Butcher** web page at **http://127.0.0.1:3000/demos/butcher/index.html**.
3. Return to the **BeEF Control Panel** tab. Select the instance listed under the **Online Browsers** in the **Hooked Browsers** panel. Open the **Commands** tab.
4. Expand the **Social Engineering** category. Scroll down and select **TabNabbing**.

- Change the number of minutes to **1**. Click the **Execute** button to start the exploit. Remain idle for at least one minute.
- Return to the tab that displayed **The Butcher** web page.

7. n the box at the center of the BeEF Basic Demo screen, type **“This is my secret”**. Return to the **BeEF Control Panel** tab. With the entry under Online Browsers selected, select **Logs** from the menu bar.

BeEF logs activity performed in the hooked browser. The text collected in the **Basic Demo** screen is displayed in clear text. All activity, including mouse clicks and navigation are recorded in the logs.
