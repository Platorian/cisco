**Protego Security Solutions**

The goal of a penetration test is to report risks of various types of cyber incidents to the customer. They will then evaluate the risks by weighing the cost of mitigating the vulnerabilities against the likelihood of attack and the potential losses that they could suffer if threat actors carry out successful exploits.

In order to enable customers to evaluate risk, sometimes it is necessary to go beyond discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities. After finding a potentially serious vulnerability that could cause considerable losses, we will get control of the subject device and see how far we can penetrate the network, and which other systems we can access. Of course, when we carry out these activities, we may have the capability of causing real damage or accessing very sensitive corporate data. We do neither.

Another thing we do is evaluate the time it takes the organizationâ€™s security personnel to discover that an exploit has occurred and to detect dangerous files on compromised systems or continuing suspicious activities.

We have carried out some successful exploits in our Pixel Paradise engagement and we will now move on to creating persistent means of increasing and maintaining access and control.

During a penetration testing engagement, after you exploit a vulnerability and compromise a system, you may perform additional activities to move laterally and pivot through other processes, applications, or systems to demonstrate how they could be compromised and how information could be exfiltrated from the organization. You may also maintain persistence by creating backdoors, creating new users, scheduling jobs and tasks, and communicating with a command and control (C2) system to launch further attacks. At the end of your engagement, you should erase any evidence that you were in a compromised system by erasing logs and any other data that could allow detection. In this module, you will learn how to perform lateral movement, maintain persistence, and cover your tracks after a penetration testing engagement.
