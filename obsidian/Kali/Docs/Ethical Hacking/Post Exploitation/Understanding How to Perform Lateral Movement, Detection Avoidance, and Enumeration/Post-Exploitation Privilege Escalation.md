In Module 7, “Cloud, Mobile, and IoT Security,” you learned that **_privilege escalation_** is the act of gaining access to resources that normally would be protected from an application or a user. This results in a user gaining additional privileges beyond those that were originally intended by the developer of the application.

In Module 7, you also learned that there are two general types of privilege escalation. Select each for more detail.

**Vertical Privilege Escalation**  


With vertical privilege escalation, as illustrated in Figure 8-7, a lower-privileged user accesses functions reserved for higher-privileged users (such as root or administrator access).

**Horizontal Privilege Escalation** 


With horizontal privilege escalation, as illustrated in Figure 8-8, a regular user accesses functions or content reserved for other non-root or non-admin users. For instance, say that after exploiting a system, you are able to get shell access as the user omar. However, that user does not have permissions to read some files on the system. You then find that another user, hannah, has access to those files. You then find a way to escalate your privileges as the user hannah to access those files.

Practice - Post Exploitation Privilege Escalation

ou have noticed that the Pixel Paradise website uses a user ID parameter in the URLs for authenticated access to their game reviews and support forum as shown:

**https://www.example.com/raccount?id=4e0bd995-81e7-4245-ad4a-97b619b0b00c**

You notice that the account ID values for other users can be accessed from their posts in the forum. You create a URL using another user's id and get access to their account.

What type of exploit will you document in the Pixel Paradise final pentest report?

Privilege escalation is gaining access to resources that normally would only be available to an authorized application or user. This results in a user gaining additional privileges beyond the application developer's original intention. With horizontal privilege escalation, a regular user accesses functions or content reserved for other non-root or non-admin users.
