**Protego Security Solutions**

After we have exploited a vulnerability that has let us open up a persistent communication channel with a device on the organization's network, it is time to see what we can do. We don't want to do any real damage, obviously, but we want to confirm that the conditions exist in which we can control internal machines remotely or steal or alter stored files. 

One way that we do this is to try to move laterally from host to host on the network. This lets us look at each device individually. You'd be surprised at what we can find! 

Moving from host to host is not enough. We also need to gain privileges on the host to carry out further exploits. While we can enumerate passwords in Windows shares fairly easily, there are other techniques that we sometimes need to employ to gain full access to a system. Once there, we can demonstrate how threat actors could perform discrete data exfiltration and extend their access to other systems. When our engagement with the customer is over, we write a report regarding our findings, and sometimes we show security personnel where we have been and what we have done with demonstration videos. Very persuasive!

**_Lateral movement_** (also referred to as _pivoting_) is a post-exploitation technique that can be performed using many different methods. The main goal of lateral movement is to move from one device to another to avoid detection, steal sensitive data, and maintain access to the devices to exfiltrate the **_sensitive data_**, which is data whose theft would have a severe impact to an organization. Such data typically should not be broadly shared internally or externally. Access to sensitive data should be limited and tightly controlled. **_Data exfiltration_** is the act of deliberately moving sensitive data from inside an organization to outside an organization’s perimeter without permission. In this section, you will learn the most common techniques for lateral movement.

**NOTE** Pass-the-hash is an example of a post-exploitation technique that can be used to move laterally and compromise other systems in the network. Because password hashes cannot be reversed, instead of trying to figure out what the user’s password is, an attacker can just use a password hash collected from a compromised system and then use the same hash to log in to another client or server system. Module 5, “Exploiting Wired and Wireless Networks,” covers pass-the-hash in more detail.
