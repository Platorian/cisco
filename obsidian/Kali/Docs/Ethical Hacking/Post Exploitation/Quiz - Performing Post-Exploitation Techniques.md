**Q.** An attacking system has a listener (port open), and the victim initiates a connection back to the attacking system. What type of vulnerability does this situation describe?

**A.** A reverse shell is a vulnerability in which an attacking system has a listener (port open), and the victim initiates a connection back to the attacking system. With a bind shell, an attacker opens a port or a listener on the compromised system and waits for a connection. With horizontal privilege escalation, a regular user accesses functions or content reserved for other non-root or non-admin users. With vertical privilege escalation, a lower-privileged user accesses functions reserved for higher-privileged users, such as root or administrator access.
