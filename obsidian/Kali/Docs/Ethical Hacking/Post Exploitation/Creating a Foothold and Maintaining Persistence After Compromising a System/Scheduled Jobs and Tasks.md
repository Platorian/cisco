Windows has a command that attackers can use to schedule automated execution of tasks on a local or remote computer. You can use this functionality for post-exploitation and persistence. You can take advantage of the Windows Task Scheduler to bypass User Account Control (UAC) if the user has access to its graphical interface. This is possible because the security option runs with the system’s highest privileges. When a Windows user creates a new task, the system typically doesn’t require the user to authenticate with an administrator account.

**NOTE** You can access the scheduled tasks of a Windows system by navigating to **Start -> Administrative Tools -> Task Scheduler**. Alternatively, you can press the **Windows key+R** to open the Run dialog box and then type **taskschd.msc** and press **Enter**.

Scheduled tasks can also be used to steal data over time without raising alarms. In Windows, Task Scheduler can be leveraged to schedule jobs that may use a significant amount of CPU resources and network bandwidth. This is helpful when huge files are to be compressed and transferred over a network (especially if you set them to execute at night or during weekends, when no users will be on the victim’s system).
