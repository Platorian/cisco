Not only do attackers carry out one-time exploits. If they have good access and it appears that they can get into databases and file spaces that store sensitive content, they will stick around. They can do many things over time, if they have persistent access. It can take a long time to exfiltrate data, for example. To avoid detection, hackers may divide the files they are stealing into very small pieces and actually send them out hidden in DNS queries. Sometimes it takes months to steal the files.

There are a lot of ways to maintainÂ a presence in a hacked network. We like to establish a persistent communication channel with at least one exploited device in order to show the customer that they are not detecting such exploits quickly enough to prevent damage.

It is important to learn about how to maintain persistent access and the kinds of things that will lead to further exploits once access has been gained.

After the exploitation phase, you need to maintain a foothold in a compromised system to perform additional tasks, such as installing and/or modifying services to connect back to the compromised system. You can maintain the persistence of a compromised system in a number of ways, including the following:

- Creating a bind or reverse shell
- Creating and manipulating scheduled jobs and tasks
- Creating custom daemons and processes
- Creating new users
- Creating additional backdoors

When you maintain persistence in a compromised system, you can take several actions, such as the following:

- Uploading additional tools
- Using local system tools
- Performing ARP scans and ping sweeps
- Conducting DNS and directory services enumeration
- Launching brute-force attacks
- Performing additional enumeration of users, groups, forests, sensitive data, and unencrypted files
- Performing system manipulation using management protocols (for example, WinRM, WMI, SMB, SNMP) and compromised credentials
- Executing additional exploits

You can also take several actions through the compromised system, including the following:

- Configuring port forwarding
- Creating SSH tunnels or proxies to communicate to the internal network
- Using a VPN to access the internal network
